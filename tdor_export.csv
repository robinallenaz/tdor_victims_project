Her body was found with signs of violence near the Juchitán-Tehuantepec federal highway.

In 2020, photographer Maria Elena Valdés portrayed her as part of [Muxelandia](https://materia.press/muxelandia-maria-elena-valdes-reveals-a-world-of-non-binary-radical-acceptance/), a photography project that seeks to expand the possibilities of a world beyond binarism.

> Mayte LM, a member of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual (LGBT) community, was murdered in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca.
> 
> The young woman of Juchiteco origin was found on Tuesday morning, with a gunshot wound, next to federal highway 185, Tehuantepec-Juchitán section, a few meters from the junction that leads to the Rancho Llano municipal agency in the neighboring town of San Blas Atempa.
> 
> Her body was found among some bushes and rubbish. Her face was covered, her hands tied behind her back, and her bare feet were tied with tape as signs of the torture she suffered before being killed. At the time of her death she was wearing a pink blouse and blue jeans. The corresponding investigation file was opened for this incident.
> 
> As of Tuesday afternoon, the motive for the crime remains unknown, although authorities say they have not ruled out any line of investigation.
> 
> Members of the LGBT community mourned the death and demanded justice.
> 
> ""With profound indignation and pain, we at the Trans Indigenous and Afro-descendant Meeting of the State of Oaxaca strongly condemn the murder of our colleague Mayte Matus Regalado,"" the organizing group announced on the same day.
> 
> ""This act of extreme violence reminds us of the vulnerability that trans women face in our society, particularly in regions such as the Isthmus, where discrimination and violence based on gender and identity are exacerbated,"" they said.
> 
> They therefore demanded a thorough investigation to clarify this ""hate crime,"" achieve justice and end impunity for this community, as well as the implementation of effective public policies that guarantee the security and full exercise of human rights of trans, indigenous and Afro-descendant people in the state.

> Honee Walker, a 37-year-old Black transgender woman, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in Rochester, N.Y., last Wednesday. Walker has been misgendered and deadnamed in local media reports.
> 
> The accident occurred just before midnight. Walker was a pedestrian, and the driver who hit her left the scene, TV station WHAM reports. She was pronounced dead soon afterward. The driver and vehicle have since been identified, but no arrests have been made, and the accident remains under investigation.
> 
> After the incident, Walker’s family gave her name to media outlets, but some have not corrected their reporting. The latest WHAM story, however, states her correct name and refers to her as a ""pedestrian"" and ""victim,"" with no gender mentioned.
> 
> “The victim identified both publicly and privately as a transgender woman,” says a press release from Blaque/Out Magazine.
> 
> “Although several stations have posted updates to the story, the accepted media practice would be to correct the original misreported piece in print if possible and digitally everywhere it originally appeared,” the release continues. “This isn’t just new information, it is considered disrespectful and a documented form of transphobia, transmisia, prejudice and oppression visited upon the LGBTQIA+ but specifically the Trans community.
>
> ""Despite the fact that your original reporting information was likely provided by [the Rochester Police Department], organizations nationwide track the disproportionate rate of deaths of Trans community members, specifically Black Trans women and those numbers are deeply skewed when the media misreports the accurate identity of the individual. These errors whether purposeful or in ignorance can even lead to delayed justice for families and victims.”

> Sistergirl is a term used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to describe gender-diverse people that have a female spirit and take on female roles in the community. Crystal Love, the matriarch of Tiwi sistergirls, said she had lost part of herself when her daughter was killed on Monday.
> 
> The victim's name is not being used for cultural reasons.
> 
> ""We are living in a world that is all messed up...she was good person, a kind person,"" Aunty Crystal said. ""She had a good life, she had family and friends who love her, our communities that love her, but it was just tragic, because...sometimes some people have bigger dreams, she had those.""
> 
> Members of the Tiwi sistergirl community refer to Aunty Crystal as mother, as she has advocated to bring both culture and western worlds together for Indigenous transgender communities.
> 
> Northern Territory Police said they were called to a unit complex in Darwin's northern suburb of Malak about 9:35pm where officers found the victim unconscious in the backyard, with a stab wound in her chest. Officers performed CPR but the 37-year-old was declared dead after paramedics arrived. 
> 
> Police say a 34-year-old man, believed to be related to the victim, was arrested at the scene and is expected to be charged later on Tuesday.


*Editor's Note: The following information was given by the person who submitted the report and explains the background in some detail:*

> In First Nations Australian culture, trans individuals are referred to in English as sistergirls or brotherboys, these generally map over to trans feminine and trans masculine people respectively, but not in all cases (sometimes a butch woman may identify as a brotherboy for example)
>
> Australia is home to over 200 unique Indigenous nations, each with its own protocol regarding death. Generally speaking, names and depictions of the dead are not to be said or reproduced during a mourning period, which can last years depending on the person.
>
> This includes inadvertent usage of the persons name, for example, within a community, e.g. if someone was named Sun, that word would be replaced with adjectives (day star, etc) or a temporary replacement word during that mourning period.
>
> This is because in many Indigenous cultures, there is a belief that using their names or images regardless of context can prevent the person from moving on. 
>
> For the purposes of reporting Australian First Nations deaths, it would be appropriate to not use their name or photos, but descriptions of the person are fine and are actually used as a substitute for explaining the person being talked about ""The woman who painted"" for example.

> FARGO — A former Fargo resident who led an organization to help transgender people in the United States emigrate to other countries, has died.
> 
> Rynn Willgohs, 52, died on Oct. 8, according to her obituary, published in the High Plains Reader on Oct. 13. At the time of her death, Willgohs was working through the asylum and immigration process in Finland.
> 
> Willgohs founded TRANSport, a nonprofit organization seeking to help at-risk transgender people leave the U.S. by assisting with paperwork, paying for associated costs and providing resettlement support.
> 
> In an interview with The Forum in 2022, Willgohs, a transgender woman, talked about her plans to move abroad. She said a factor in her decision to leave the U.S. was her fear that state and federal governments would roll back protections for transgender people.
> 
> She said that during a summer trip to Iceland, she realized she felt more at home in Icelandic society than she had felt in the U.S. Being transgender was not an issue there, but in the U.S. she always felt threatened or treated as an outsider, she told The Forum.
> 
> “It’s a whole different world over there,” Willgohs told The Forum, explaining that it took some getting used to being seen as just another person.
> 
> Willgohs said she had been targeted for being transgender in Fargo, including being stalked and threatened, and believed that her work to advance transgender rights in the city made her more of a target.
> 
> In the same interview, Willgohs talked about her plans for TRANSport. She hoped TRANSport could help cover the cost of name changes, gender marker changes, hormone treatments, plane tickets and passport costs as a person settled in a new country. TRANSport is incorporated under the 501c3 umbrella of the Pride Collective and Community Center, another Fargo nonprofit organization.
> 
> Kendra Lewellyn, president of the Pride Collective and Community Center Board, said Willgohs was a passionate fighter for trans rights through TRANSport and her personal activism.
> 
> “The community has just lost a really dedicated advocate, and she was seeking asylum thousands of miles away, but her story and her are just such a part of the Fargo-Moorhead story and of the LGBTQ community in our area,” she said. “Whether she was thousands of miles away or not, more than ever, people feel it.”

> A 20-year-old woman, Kaile Villar Pons,  died early this morning as a result of a stabbing that occurred this morning in Pamplona. The incident took place this morning at 1:15 in the Rochapea neighborhood. Initially it was reported that the deceased was a man.
> 
> According to Navarra.com, a man of Moroccan nationality has stabbed the woman on calle Carmen Baroja Nessi.
> 
> Officers from the Pamplona Municipal Police and an emergency medical team were dispatched to the scene and transported the still injured woman to the University Hospital of Navarra in an advanced life support ambulance.
> 
> However the woman died due to the severity of the stab wounds.
> 
> Initial investigations appear to indicate that an argument began between the two, which ended tragically. The suspect allegedly stabbed the daughter of the owner of the flat, where several people were staying, several times, one of which was fatal, in the chest. 
> 
> The Municipal Police of Pamplona have confirmed the arrest of a man as the alleged perpetrator of these events and it is expected that he will be brought before a court later today or early tomorrow morning.

Although Kaile's killing was widely reported in the media, the fact that she was trans was barely mentioned so her death was easily missed. Although in one respect this is progressiive - in an ideal world the fact that she was trans should not matter - however as things stand now it can be viewed as erasure of a vulnerable minority.

Like most murders of trans people, her murder quickly fell out of the headlines.

Despite the brutality of Kaile's murder, the Ministerio de Igualdad (Spanish Ministry for Equality) did not either condemn the murder or register the case as a femicide.

As a trans person of Palestinian origin the genocide in Gaza and the current anti-trans rhetoric in the media and politics must have hit her hard.

> Today, I want us to remember 22-year-old Megan Jordan Kridli. She was a friend, collaborator, and powerhouse Palestinian trans youth organizer. I first met her last year when she invited me to speak at her university. Her insightfulness, activist skills, and brilliance immediately blew me away. She organized with numerous groups between her college genders and sexualities club to an international social justice publication - all before the age of 18!

I invited her to collaborate on some projects a few months ago, but she didn’t have time as her work and pressure ballooned. I did not know how straining it all was. She ended her life right after the anniversary of the genocide, the same month her senator promised to ban healthcare for trans girls like her.

> Paris, France; October 17, 2024: JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) condemns in the strongest possible terms the tragic and senseless murder of Ayub Ali, a 47-year-old transgender woman, who was brutally killed on October 12, 2024, in Tangail, Bangladesh. Her body, bearing clear signs of violence, was discovered the following morning in an abandoned house near the microbus stand in the new bus stand area of Tangail. The police found a cloth tightly wrapped around her neck, with evidence of struggle, suggesting that she may have been strangled. A murder case has been filed, and investigations are underway to bring those responsible to justice.
> 
> ""This heinous crime is not just an attack on an individual but a stark reminder of the constant danger faced by transgender people in Bangladesh and around the world. It reflects the deep-rooted discrimination and violence that the transgender community continues to suffer,"" said Robert Simon, French LGBT rights activist and Chief Adviser of JMBF. ""Ayub Ali's story of resilience and determination in the face of adversity underscores the urgent need for societal change. No one should face such a fate simply for living their truth.""
> 
> Ayub Ali's life was one of struggle, resilience, and hope. Originally from the Bhavanipur Patuli area of Tangail Sadar Upazila, Ayub Ali faced societal exclusion and limited job opportunities due to her gender identity. Like many in her community, she initially survived by collecting money in markets and on public transportation. Finding this work demeaning, she sought a more dignified path, starting a small cloth business despite numerous challenges. She sold fabrics in rural areas and participated in seasonal sales during festivals like Eid and Puja. Ayub Ali also expressed herself through the performing arts, joining dance groups during festive occasions and acting in traditional ""Yatrapala"" performances, embodying female roles on stage.

Rick Alastor Newman,29,,,,trans_flag.jpg,17 Oct 2024,,"Bozeman, Montana",USA,US,45.6931354,-111.0649734,violence,shot,"Rick was shot by police. From the information available, it appears that he was experiencing a mental health crisis at the time.

News reports of his death misgender him and describe him as the aggressor, while conveniently ignoring the fact that the local police were likely untrained to deal with people experiencing mental health crises and - at least from the information available - did not attempt to de-escalate the situation.

> His name was Rick Alastor Newman (he/him) and he was a trans man who lived in Bozeman, MT, USA and was shot and murdered by the police. Much of the news coverage (ex. https://www.facebook.com/kxlhtv/posts/sheriffcoroner-has-identified-rick-alastor-newman-as-the-person-who-died-details/1055719919836265/) around his death misgenders and/or deadnames him. He is greatly missed by his Montanan trans community. He was an artist, storyteller, and brother.

> On October 22nd, my baby girl Alex was found lifeless in a park due to [suicide method redacted]. She came into this world to forge a new path and open the minds of those who rejected the LGBTQ community, as well as those within the community who turned against each other. She understood that this journey was difficult, unfair, and filled with heartbreak and suffering, yet she chose to push forward.
> 
> I envision her as a bull in a Spanish bullfight. Like the bull, she kept running and fighting even as the torero and his assistants inflicted wounds upon her. Ultimately, the final sword pierced her heart, tearing apart the three components of her being: her body, her soul, and her spirit. At that moment, everything was broken, and she took her last breath. I hope, with a sincere and heavy heart, that this event won’t be in vain. I wish that, with her passing, others will realize that when we leave this 3D dimension and earthly life, it won’t matter what our gender, race, social status, or beliefs are. Where we are headed, there are no such titles; it is a place of love and happiness. We are all connected and come from the same source. I will miss her so much, I will miss her saying or texting “I love you, Mom”. I am glad I could save some of the messages she left, I will be able to hear her physically which will give me comfort or a reason to cry when I am alone. Either way, it will help me to stay strong.

A third trans woman named Shawki who also lived there survived the attack.

> PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Two men armed with daggers killed two transgender women at their home in conservative northwest Pakistan overnight before fleeing the scene, police said, a sign of increasing violence against trans people in the country.
> 
> The killings happened Sunday night in Mardan, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Fahim Khan said. He said the motive behind the killings was unclear and officers are still investigating, and the victims had been buried at a local graveyard.
> 
> Khan said that two suspects had also been arrested in connection with the killings, but he refused to share any further details. Khan also refused to confirm or deny whether the men were directly involved in the attack.

Three suspects were subsequently arrested and confessed to the attack. Reportedly they were part of an organised criminal gang who targetted trans people.

A cellphone left in the room identified her killer as a pastor, who, according to the prosecutor, killed her after he discovered she was trans.

> A homicide motivated by a trivial argument and committed through asphyxiation. Thus, prosecutor Fabio Perez Fernandez, who works before the Jury Court of Santos, on the coast of São Paulo, summarized the murder of Luane Costa da Silva, a trans woman, and denounced the accused of committing it: engineer Antonio Lima dos Santos Neto, 45 years old, who said during questioning to the police that he was also a pastor of a church.
>
> The crime took place on the evening of the 22nd in room number 10 of the Danúbio Hotel, located on Rua Rangel Pestana, in Vila Mathias. The engineer arrived at the scene by car with the victim at 8:00 p.m., but he was the only one who walked to the reception, where he paid R$60.00 for a one-hour stay. He then walked to the stairs, where Luane was waiting for him, and they both headed to the suite. About half an hour later, Antonio left alone in the vehicle.
>
> The formal accusation by the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office (MP) was filed on Wednesday (31). In his initial accusation, the prosecutor states that “the accused and the victim were going to have a sexual encounter, at which point Antônio realized that the victim was a transsexual woman and, therefore, gave up on the sexual encounter. Given the cancellation of the sexual encounter, the accused and the victim had a trivial argument”.
>
> Because of this disagreement, according to Perez, “Antônio squeezed Luane’s neck until she died by asphyxiation.” Futile motive and asphyxiation are qualifiers of homicide, which make it a heinous crime and increase its sentence to 12 to 30 years. Without the qualifiers, homicide would be considered simple and punishable by six to 20 years in prison, without receiving the harsher treatment due to the heinousness.

> Acceptess-T is deeply mourning again. We lost a trans woman from the Acceptess-T family. Frida was a Peruvian trans woman, who arrived in France in 2008 and since then she has been practicing sex work in the Boulogne forest in Paris.
> 
> Frida was one of the first people involved in our association, from her early days. She was always mobilized at historical events and marches Acceptess-T attended against the crime of extortion law, where she was persecuted by the French state, identity checks and many nights spent in custody, simply to practice sex work freely and independently.
>
> Frida was also present at the marches and events for the law of Marriage for All, at all the Existrans marches and every December 1st, World AIDS Day. Frida also marked her presence in 2016 when we mobilized against the anti-prostitution law and she was on the front lines screaming her rage because she understood that by wanting to penalize clients sex workers would be forced to hide and seek to find other strategies to keep working and prevent the police from being able to control and penalize customers.
>
> Frida was also on the front lines with a lot of anger after the murders of Vanesa Campos in 2018, Jessica Sarmiento in 2020 and Ivana in 2022. All victims of a context of serious insecurity because of this cursed law against prostitution in France.
> 
> Unfortunately, on August 8, 2022, this same law targeted Frida. That night, she was in the woods of Boulogne, trying to make a living to continue helping her mother and family in Peru. She had a violent altercation with a man who wanted to obtain free sexual services and harassed Frida and her colleagues who were working nearby. This stranger attacked Frida from behind with an iron bar, piercing and breaking her spine, breaking her lung and destroying her chest.
> 
> Frida was reduced to a tetraplegic life, and spent more than two years in hospital at the Kremlin Bicêtre hospital near Paris, until October 24, the day she died, after suffering the consequences of this barbaric aggression.
>
> If Frida died as a result of this assault, we want to remind that she is a victim of murder, and we demand that this characterization be recognized by the doctors in the act of death as well as by the investigating judge. It is also time to recall that this investigation has been slow and that we have not seen any real willingness to deepen or give it more interest. It’s also time to remember that the 2016 Anti-Prostitution Act has increased insecurity for free and independent sex workers like Frida and all those murdered in the past eight years.
>
> The abolitionist and prohibition system in France is responsible for the loss of lives in our communities. We want the safety, the rights and the opportunity to practice sex work without fear, without having to hide and without carrying the status of victims of prostitution. Frida, your memory will always live present and be part of the chapters of our history.
>
> Your deaths, like those of Vanesa, Jessyca, Ivana and Geraldine, remind us of how much danger trans women sex workers, especially migrants and undocumented, are. It is for them and through them that we will continue to fight. It is for them that we will continue to shout in Paris and in every corner of the world, on TDOR day and anytime, that trans people are murdered and that the state is totally indifferent. Trans murdered, complicit state. We created a fund raiser to help Frida's sister and family with legal costs and repatriation of her body, as well as funeral costs in Ancash, Peru. Please spread this information or donate if you can.

*[Editor's Note: According to a public submission to a survey by TDoR France, Frida may have died by suicide. While this has not been confirmed, her death is categorised as by violence here due to the circumstances preceding it]*

She was the vice president of MTSU’s student LGBTQ+ organization MT Lambda.

> Serenity Birdsong, a transgender student at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), killed themselves on Monday inside the campus’ James E. Walker Library. Birdsong was vice president of MTSU’s student LGBTQ+ organization MT Lambda.
> 
> The school canceled classes and closed the library on Tuesday but resumed normal operations on Wednesday. Additional details about Birdsong’s suicide have neither been made publicly available nor reported by the media.
> 
> “Serenity was more than an officer to us; many of us considered Serenity our friend, and her ability to light up a room, paired with her wholesome demeanor, made her welcome anywhere, but especially in Lambda where we are burdened by the darkness of existing in a world so often cruel to us. And it is this darkness that snuffed out Serenity’s light,” MT Lambda wrote in a Tuesday afternoon Instagram post marking Birdsong’s suicide.
> 
> The group had planned on hosting a Halloween party on Wednesday but instead will host a discussion and grieving space for people in memory of Birdsong. Additionally, the Student Government Association will hold a vigil on Wednesday at 6 p.m. local time in front of the campus library. The MTSU campus publication has also highlighted the availability of counseling services for students.
 
MT Lambda’s post memorializing Birdsong included a poem written by her. An extract from the poem is reproduced below:

<pre>
 “The trouble of life both big and small
  seem to fade as the obstacles falls.
  Now we embark on a new adventure
  one with which we may joke and gesture.
  
  But all in all, that which I hope most
  is that I spend time with those I love, before I’m a ghost.”
</pre>

She and her partner Oswaldo Ramírez were robbed and killed in their home during a party.

> The Manrique Central community in Medellín woke up on Tuesday to the news of a double homicide that has shocked the local population. Two people belonging to the LGBTIQ+ community, including a well-known trans activist known as Juana, were found dead inside a home. Both bodies had multiple stab wounds, which has led the authorities to launch an operation to find those responsible for this violent act.
> 
> According to preliminary reports, the victims had attended a party in a section of downtown Medellín, and afterward, they decided to continue the celebration at a house in Manrique Central. It was there that, in the midst of the drinks, a fight broke out between the attendees, triggering the attack. A third person, who managed to escape from the house, was the one who notified the authorities, after showing up wounded at a health center. The person said he had witnessed the attack and provided initial information about what happened.
> 
> This double homicide has rekindled concerns about the violence faced by the LGBTIQ+ community in the country. Human rights organisations, such as Caribe Afirmativo, have expressed concern about the increase in attacks against people from this community in Colombia. According to their records, so far this year, 40 LGBTIQ+ people have been murdered in the country, of which 22 are trans people, a group that faces particular vulnerability. The organisation has asked the authorities to investigate the case under the hypothesis of a crime motivated by prejudice, given the recurrent documented violence against this population.

During the early hours of Tuesday 31st October Juana's friend María Sorelly Sánchez Arismendy, 61, was stabbed outside her home afer attending Juana's wake. Her killer, who appears to have been waiting for her, fled on a motorcycle with an accomplice.

> Before midnight, María Sorelly called a taxi from the funeral home in the center of Medellín to her home. When she arrived at her destination, she was apparently approached by a man who stabbed her and killed her on the spot.
>
> According to witnesses, the killer, who was wearing a green raincoat and a helmet, was waiting to attack her. He then got on a motorcycle driven by his accomplice and fled the scene.

In late March 2025 Jaminson Andrés Palomeque Córdoba was sentenced to 24 years in prison for homicide and azggravated robbery.

> It was not an assault or a fight. The beating was carried out with such cruelty, hatred and extreme violence that it caused brain death, which days later shut down her entire body.
> 
> Yumiko, like many trans women, was involved in sex work due to a lack of opportunities. Her case did not make it into the news agenda, which at the time revolved around the social crisis. The only thing left of the crime was the request for justice from her colleagues on social media and the search for help to bury her.   
> 
> Yumiko's murder is the fourth hate crime recorded in Bolivia in 2024 and the third transfemicide of the year, according to the LGBT Rights Observatory . The number is the highest publicly recorded among the annual figures reported in the last 15 years, in which there are 28 hate crimes, of which 21 are femicides.

> Caring Cal, who was autistic and transgender, volunteered to speak to callers on The Samaritans helpline, but personally struggled with [their] own mental health issues.

Her home had been ransacked and some of her belongings were missing,

Her death was classified as a homicide and a minor was arrested.

> On November 3, at around 8:30 in the morning, the Police reported a fire at 1400 República Siria. Upon entering and putting out the fire, the Civil Defense and Firefighters teams found the body of Rosario Sansone.
> 
> The 47-year-old trans woman was found dead in a prone position on a bed. There was a mess around her and her cell phone and documentation were found to be missing.
> 
> The Second Police Station and the DDI carried out the investigation and analysed digital transaction records and security camera recordings. This led to a raid that was carried out last night at a house on Francia 800.
> 
> There, a minor was arrested. Credit cards, debit cards and other digital items belonging to the victim were seized.
> 
> The case was reclassified as homicide, and the minor was placed at the disposal of the Juvenile Prosecutor's Office on duty.

Rosario was a well-known Salta LGBTQIA+ activist in the city and her murder was greeted with shock by many.

> Rosario Sansone, a trans activist and leader in Bahía Blanca, spoke with Total Normalidad about her participation in the first Parliament of Diversities in the Provincial Chamber of Deputies, organized by the Frente de Todos bloc. The event took place within the framework of the 11th anniversary of the passing of the Gender Identity Law and the International Day of the Fight against Discrimination due to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. ""We are living in a beautiful time, full of rights.""
> 
> Sansone appeared, together with the Mar del Plata representative Yohana Maidana, to speak about the importance of trans resistance and demand the sanction of the transvestite-trans reparation law. The project establishes a reparatory pension for victims of institutional violence due to reasons of gender identity. “Historical reparation would be like compensation, that the State recognizes what it did to us, leaving us to our fate. Trans resistance has advanced so much that it is unimaginable that we continue to be denied rights.”

On 16th November 2024 a 17 year-old was arrested and charged with her murder.

A friend said of her: ""I will never know anyone quite like Sydney again. She was truly one of a kind, and a dear friend. I’ll carry our many memories. Rest easy Syd.""

> On November 5th, 2024, Sydney Leigh Phillips passed away from suicide. She was living in East Islip, NY, USA. She was born July 31st, 2002. I personally didn't know Sydney, but her life was shared with me from a member of the community that was close to her. I believe she attended the University of Rhode Island.

She was 27. #SayHerName #TransLivesMatter #TDoR",https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2024/11/10/santrosa_sinop-mato-grosso-brazil_b8c6ebc7,qrcodes/b8c6ebc7.png
Kyla Jane Walker,39,10 Jan 1985,photos/2024_11_10_Kyla-Jane-Walker.jpg,by email,thumbnails/2024_11_10_Kyla-Jane-Walker.jpg,10 Nov 2024,,"Austin, Texas",USA,US,30.1912477,-97.7359895,violence,run over,"Kyla died after being struck by a vehicle in a hit and run. When she transitioned she had reportedly been ostracised by all of her birth family other than her sister.

Aldair Albiter-Casas was arrested on a charge of collision involving death a week later on 17th January.

> My beautiful sister was struck by a vehicle and killed in a hit and run in Austin, TX on Sunday. When she transitioned, she was ostracized by everyone in our religious family. But not me, she became mine.
> 
> She was the most brilliant human I've ever encountered a fierce advocate for the weird and wonderful that made up her found family. I'm utterly devastated and she leaves a hole in my heart that will never be filled.
> 
> I have fought tooth and nail to respect her wishes and honor her legacy against my mother who abandoned her 10 years ago. She will be cremated and placed into a tree urn that will hopefully one day grow in my back yard for my children who adored her to climb. 
> 
> I'm not sure what I'm trying to do with this. I love this group and the acceptance and love her and she deserves to have her memory flung far and wide. 
> 
> She mattered. And she mattered to me.
> 
> Thank you all. Her last words on her final social media post were this:
> 
> ""Resist Despair""
> 
> Love you Forever Kyla Walker 
> 
> Kyla Jane Walker (January 10,1985 - November 10,2024)
> 
> UPDATE
> 
> Y'all have me crying at work I was not expecting this.
> 
> Not a single member of my family offered condolences, sent flowers, or offered money for her funeral. My wife and I worked tirelessly to honor her wishes and both her death certificate and cremation certificate use her legal name Kyla Jane Walker and are addressed to me as I claimed her in death the same way I did in life. 
> 
> We made the crash site a memorial to honor her. Her found family gifted me two of her guitars that now sit in my music room (our shared passion). My wife and I got tattoos of her handwriting that she wrote in our wedding book. I got a tattoo that she had on her neck on my leg in the trans colors. We celebrated her 40th birthday party January 10 with her ashes in a dark humor way that she would have absolutely loved (we put a party hat and googly eyes on her ashes) and then a week later, her murderer was arrested thanks in part to the massive amount of work my wife did bc she was not satisfied with APD's response. He is currently in jail charged with 4 felonies awaiting his court date.
> 
> Words will never express what your kind words have meant to me. In my darkest hour, I reached out to the Internet for kindness because my family failed me. They answered then, and 3 months later, y'all have answered today
> 
> Resist Despair Always. For Kyla.

Leia Sampson-Grimbly,17,,,,trans_flag.jpg,11 Nov 2024,,Suffolk,United Kingdom,GB,52.3150179,1.0022181,suicide,suicide,"Leia died by suicide while awaiting a first appointment at an NHS Gender Identity Clinic. A coroner [ruled that her life could have been saved if waiting times were shorter](https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/leia-sampson-grimbly-prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2/).

*[Editor's Note: The date of Leia's death was not reported but is thought to have been in late August 2024. The date given here is the date of the start of the coroner's investigation into her death, 11th November 2024]*

> A 17-year-old girl who took her own life waiting to be seen by an NHS gender clinic could have been saved if wait times were shorter, a coroner has ruled.
> 
> Leia Sampson-Grimbly, a 17-year-old trans girl, died by suicide in 2024 following a struggle with her mental health while waiting to be seen by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust.
> 
> Senior coroner, Andrew Walker, said her death was preventable and that the Camden-based gender clinic’s wait times were “far too long. Having to battle with changes to her body without receiving the necessary preventative treatment, together with the many hurdles and setbacks, gradually eroded her belief that she would succeed and everything would be alright,” he said.
> 
> Described as “complex, kind, intelligent, and determined,” Leia’s mental health reportedly deteriorated following the Tavistock’s closure in 2024 under recommendations from the controversial Cass Report on trans youth healthcare provision.
> 
> The clinic, which was the only NHS centre providing trans youth care, has been gradually replaced by regional hubs across England and Wales.
> 
> Mr Walker urged NHS gender clinics to do more to bring down the waiting lists to help prevent mental health risks among those waiting for care.
> 
> In a statement, a spokesperson for the trans campaign group TransLuscent said Leia’s death was a “direct consequence of a healthcare system designed to delay, obstruct, and ultimately deny necessary medical treatment to vulnerable trans youth.”
> 
> It comes just days after an eye-opening report revealed that many patients are likely to wait a third of their lifetime for a first appointment at an NHS gender clinic in the UK, with some waiting as long as 224 years. Data obtained by QueerAF, in association with What the Trans?! and Claire’s Trans Talks, revealed that, as of March 2025, 48,000 people were waiting for a first appointment at one of the UK’s 15 gender clinics. For every person seen in 2024, four more people joined the list.
> 
> Wait times for each clinic vary massively, from just three months in Nottingham, to 41 years in Belfast, and a staggering 224 years in Glasgow.
> 
> Data from 2024 suggests that trans adults are six times more likely to have attempted suicide compared to cisgender people, with many citing restrictions in accessing gender-affirming care as a major contributor to their poor mental health.

> RAIPUR: Power tussle, rivalry, and betrayal with the community led to the gruesome murder of a transgender in Baloda Bazar district of Chhattisgarh. The body of Kajal, also known as Coca Cola, was recovered from an abandoned quarry in village Dhabadih on Monday. Baloda Bazar police have cracked the blind murder mystery of the transgender on Wednesday with the arrest of five people. Police claimed that Rs 12 lakh were paid to contract killers to execute the murder by a rival group within the transgender community.
> 
> Kajal was a strong contender for the ‘guru gaddi', the head of the community in Raipur. In a bid to eliminate her from the path, a rival, Tapasya, allegedly orchestrated the murder, by paying 12 lakh to contract killers.
> 
> Police said Tapasya, who originally hails from Mumbai, teamed up with Nisha, another transgender [person] from Raipur, to plot Kajal's murder. The duo began planning in Sep 2024 and Tapasya raised the funds and paid Rs 6 lakh to a contract killer through Nisha. However, the initial hitman was arrested in an unrelated case, forcing them to hire two new killers, Ankush and Kuldeep.
> Two days before the murder, Nisha and driver Himanshu, visited the quarry.
> 
> On the evening of Nov 17, Nisha lured Kajal into her car on the pretext of collecting Rs 3 lakh from an acquaintance and promising her a share of Rs 1.5 lakh. They were accompanied by the driver Himanshu. Kajal joined them clueless that it was a trap. The killers, Ankush and Kuldeep, followed them on a motorcycle. The car was stopped near Amera village, where Ankush and Kuldeep handed over the cash to Nisha. From the amount Kajal took 1.5 lakh for herself, unaware of the impending danger.
> 
> They then proceeded to the quarry. Under the cover of darkness, Nisha and Himanshu left Kajal at the site, pretending to retrieve something from the car. Moments later, Ankush and Kuldeep ambushed Kajal, stabbing her multiple times. Kajal's body was thrown into the quarry to make it appear like an accidental drowning.
> 
> The body was found floating in the quarry the next day. Police recovered three bundles of Rs 500 notes totalling Rs 1.5 lakh from her clothing, raising suspicions. Forensic teams gathered evidence pointing to foul play. Using cyber forensics and technical surveillance, the police zeroed in on the suspects. By Wednesday, all five accused were in custody. They were identified as Tapasya, alias '[deadname], the alleged mastermind, Nisha Srivastava and accomplice Ankush Chaudhary and Kuldeep Kuril, the contract killers Himanshu Banjare, driver Ankush Chaudhary and Kuldeep Kuril. The police also seized Rs 10.5 lakh cash, a car, a motorcycle and the murder weapon from their possession.

Friends say Ra'Lasia Wright was well-known in the Minneapolis club scene and had no connection to the neighborhood where her body was found.

Earlier in 2024 Ra'Lasia gave an interview in which she addressed some of the issues around her legal history, etc:

According to *JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France*, her death appears to be a premeditated act of murder disguised as natural causes.

The fact that her possessions were looted following her death supports this.

> Statement: JMBF Calls for Adequate Investigation into the Alleged Murder of Mau Hijra in Jessore
> 
> Paris, France; January 2, 2025: France-based human rights organization, JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF), is deeply appalled and outraged by the suspicious and tragic death of Mau Hijra in Jessore, Bangladesh, which appears to be a premeditated act of murder disguised as a natural death on December 1, 2024.
> 
> JMBF believes that such abhorrent acts not only represent a blatant violation of human dignity but also highlight the rampant impunity and discrimination faced by marginalized communities, particularly the Hijra community in Bangladesh.
> 
> The organization asserts that the allegations against Mau Hijra's house owner, Fateh Begum, along with her associates—who are accused of orchestrating her death and looting her possessions—demand an immediate and uncompromising investigation.
> 
> Additionally, the Hijra community’s voice, as articulated by Bhavna Hijra, deserves urgent attention and support. No individual or community should endure such heinous acts of violence, neglect, and theft, especially in a society that claims to uphold justice and equality.
> 
> “The death of Mau Hijra and the looting of her belongings reflect a troubling pattern of systemic neglect and discrimination against the Hijra community in Bangladesh. We urge the Bangladeshi authorities to take swift and decisive action to ensure justice is served and to prevent such tragedies in the future,” said Robert Simon, Chief Adviser of JMBF and a French human rights activist.
> 
> “This incident is not an isolated one but a symptom of deeper societal injustices. We demand the immediate formation of an independent investigative body to uncover the truth and hold all those responsible accountable. The time for justice and reform is now,” added Advocate Shahanur Islam, Founder-President of JMBF and a Bangladeshi human rights lawyer.
> 
> JMBF calls upon the authorities in Bangladesh to take decisive action, including the immediate formation of an independent and impartial investigative body to uncover the truth behind Mau Hijra’s death. All individuals involved in this alleged murder and subsequent looting must be brought to justice without delay.
> 
> JMBF emphasizes that this incident reflects a broader pattern of systemic discrimination against the Hijra community in Bangladesh, underscoring the urgent need for reforms to safeguard their rights and ensure their protection under the law.
> 
> The organization demands that the Bangladeshi government reaffirm its commitment to the principles of equality and justice by taking concrete steps to protect all vulnerable communities, including decriminalizing homosexuality and enacting legal protections for the sexual minority LGBTQ community in Bangladesh as soon as possible.
> 
> JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) stands in solidarity with the Hijra community in their pursuit of justice for Mau Hijra. Together with human rights advocates around the world, we will not rest until truth and accountability are achieved in this case. Let this be a turning point in the fight against violence, discrimination, and systemic injustice in Bangladesh.

> A search has been going on for more than two weeks after Mora, 15, disappeared following the Dec 7 Lighted Truck Parade in downtown Fort Bragg.

She had seen it on the brochures around town and called the police.
>
> Police used that evidence, cell phone location and other data to triangulate Mora’s whereabouts. They tracked him entering Noyo Bridge shortly after the parade.

A male suspect was arrested and charged as an adult in her murder.

The suspect was booked into the Tuscaloosa County Jail.

> TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (WIAT) — A Tuscaloosa family struggles to come to grips with the loss of their loved one, 18-year-old [deadname] Thompson who went by Cam.
>
> On Thursday afternoon, CBS 42 News spoke the victim’s aunt in Tuscaloosa.
>
> “We’re just devastated, like we’re still in shock,” said Tara Maneice. “We cannot believe that this happened you know so quickly, out of nowhere.”
>
> According to the Tuscaloosa County Violent Crimes Unit, Thompson, who identified as a woman, died after being shot in the 600 block of East 35th Avenue shortly after midnight on Monday. Capt. Jack Kennedy said a minor has been arrested and charged as an adult in her murder. He has been booked into the Tuscaloosa County Jail.
>
> We asked Maneice to describe her niece:
>
> “A beautiful smile, very contagious smile,” she noted, “loved fashion and the beauty industry.”
>
> Thompson, who was a transgender woman, had just completed Job Corps training and had a bright future ahead of her.
>
> “All these plans she had, she was getting ready to try to go to college, buy a new car, that they have been just wiped away in the blink of an eye, a senseless act,” Maneice added.
>
> The Tuscaloosa County Violent Crimes Unit was called to investigate Thompson’s shooting after her body was discovered near the street in a yard around 1 p.m. on Monday.
>
> Captain Kennedy said the motive appears to be related to comments that Thompson posted on social media regarding the suspect’s sexual orientation.
>
> “They were having a personal argument between each other, knew each other, and that seems to be the impetus behind this assault and murder.”
>
> Maneice said the mother believes this was a hate crime based on her daughter’s gender identity. Alabama’s hate law only pertains to crimes motivated by victim’s race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or physical or mental disability.

Her killer - a young man who according to police exhibited psychopathic tendencies - was arrested after her murdered body was found in her bed.

> The Civil Police of Água Boa (730 km from Cuiabá) complied, on the afternoon of this Sunday (22), with the judicial orders to investigate the murder of the young trans woman, Bianca Castyel, 20 years old, who was executed with 22 stab wounds on the afternoon of last Thursday (19).
>
A 17-year-old teenager was identified as the author of the brutal murder and had an arrest and internment order fulfilled by the PJC. Investigations revealed that on the night of the events the young man and the victim, who was a hairdresser, met and had sexual relations. It was also found that they had a previous relationship, however, possibly after the sexual act the suspect executed the victim with stab wounds and strangulation.
> 
> Delegate Matheus Soares Augusto, responsible for the case, highlighted the criminal profile of the suspect who presents psychopathic tendencies that are revealed by the coldness of executing the victim after the intimate act, indicating that it was something previously planned, as well as the fact that the teenager did not show remorse for what happened and the next day returned to his normal routine and went on a vacation with his family.
> 
> The victim's cell phone and the knife used in the crime were discarded by the teenager to hinder the investigation. The name of the operation ""Rest in Peace"" is a tribute to the life of the victim who was brutally executed, said the police chief.
> 
> Since the beginning of the investigation, the detective had been working with the possibility that the killer was someone close to the victim, as the property showed no signs of a break-in and the door was just opened.

She was an accomplished dancer, community activist, teacher, and mentor who taught Afro Caribbean dance and GED courses and actively mentored young people.

> In December, my friend Meka Shabazz died after [suicide method redacted].
> 
> Rates of suicide are disproportionately high for transgender people. According to a study published by the National Institutes of Health, ""41% of the transgender persons in the United States attempt for suicide at least once in their life.""
> 
> High rates of suicidality are not a symptom of being transgender. Rather, it is the difficulty of living in a threatening world that becomes too much weight to carry.
> 
> I have spent hours on the phone crying with people who loved her, danced with her and worked for justice with her.
> 
> She could be strong-willed and sometimes drive us crazy. But as we say at the United Methodist Church for All People, “No matter who you are or what you have done, you are a beloved child of God.”
> 
> Meka’s belovedness was wiped out.
> 
> **Our hatred killed her.**

> This hatred must stop.
> 
> I made an Instagram video making the same point — that we have to say ""enough"" to the hatred and division that kills people.
> 
> In response, I received a litany of hateful messages saying ""enough"" of people like me, calling transgender people sick and asking, “So what?” that Meka died.
> 
> Hatred kills.
> 
> Hatred results in the death of people like Meka.
> 
> Hatred tears up the person who is doing the hating.
> 
> Love can save others.
>
> Christmas marked the incarnation of God’s love into the world in Jesus the Christ.
> 
> I pray that this love will be born anew and that we can learn to recognize the belovedness of all people.
> 
> Hatred killed my friend. Enough.
> 
> It is time to come out of this darkness. Let us learn the truth that when we love instead of hate, we don’t only save the other, we save ourselves.  
> 
> Meka Shabazz's memorial service will take place at 1:30 p.m. Jan. 4 at the United Methodist Church for All People, 946 Parsons Ave. All are welcome to come and celebrate this beautiful life.
> 
> Rev. Dr. Joelle Henneman is pastor of United Methodist Church for All People. 


In [her blog](https://historianspeaks.org/blog/f/living-one-dance-at-a-time--meka-shabazz
) Meka wrote the following, which I think says a lot about her character:

> ""My message to all people going through a difficult time is to put on your big girl pants and humble yourself. At the peak of my success everything I worked so hard for was lost, but I persevered.
>
> ""To the LGBTQA community not everyone will be accepting of who you are. They may try to break you and harass you emotionally. Maintain yourself by keeping yourself polished. When mistreated as a result of gender discrimination, you must continue to believe in yourself. You must be persistent.""

The identity of her killer is not known, but one theory is that an argument at a funk dance the night before may have motivated the crime.

> “Jeane started out losing in life: black, trans, from the favelas. But she never stopped smiling and fighting. Life was not kind to her, as she was to life.” This is how Alexandre Silva Costa, president of the Cidade Jardim samba school, describes Jeane Lui, or “Jeje Sucesso” as she was known in the community. At 32 years old, the trans woman was brutally murdered in the early hours of this Sunday (5/1), victim of shots fired by a man, still unidentified, on Avenida Raja Gabáglia, in the Luxemburgo neighborhood, also in the Center- South Region.
> 
> An argument at a funk dance she attended the night before may have been the motivation for the crime. But before the tragic outcome, Jeane was a unique figure, beloved by the community and considered essential to the Cidade Jardim samba school — the biggest champion of the Belo Horizonte Carnival, where she had performed for almost a decade. The crime took place just a few meters from the samba school's court, a space that Jeane frequented and considered an extension of her home.
> 
> Jeane officially began her career at Cidade Jardim in 2016, but her connection with the samba school dates back much further. A resident of Morro do Papagaio, also in the South-Central Region of BH, she was a constant presence at community parties and events. For the school's president, Alexandre Silva Costa, the coexistence was natural. ""She was a part of the family. Sometimes she would sleep over at my house. Jeje had a special affection for everything, she liked to see everything in its place. She was very organized and made sure to help, even when it wasn't t her responsibility,"" he recalls.
> 
> Alexandre also highlighted the lightness and good humor that marked Jeane's personality. ""She called everyone 'success', she was very funny. That's how her nickname, Jeje Sucesso, came about. Wherever she was, she made everyone smile. People were enchanted by her,"" he told the Estado de Minas newspaper. 
> 
> A passion that, for those who knew Jeane closely, was described as a true mission, a life purpose. Skilled and dedicated, she was about to take over the production of costumes for the samba school and lead sewing workshops, which help raise funds for Cidade Jardim. Before that, she planned to participate in a 15-day intensive course in Espírito Santo, with the trip scheduled for this Tuesday (7/1). ""Everything that was needed, even things that were beyond her control, she did. She was a person with a great spirit, always willing to help"", recalls Alexandre.
> 
> The news of Jeane's death left everyone in the community shaken. The family was unable to inform the police whether she had been receiving threats. For Cidade Jardim, the loss is irreparable. ""She was our 'success'. A person who transformed any environment into a lighter and more fun place"", says Alexandre, who lives next to the school's court and heard the shots that ended his friend's life. ""It was a cowardly thing to do. Hearing the shots and then finding out that it was her, it was devastating"", he says.
> 
> An argument at a funk dance may have been the trigger for Jeane's murder. Known by everyone at the party, according to witnesses' reports to Estado de Minas , she got into a fight with a man, who has not yet been identified, and hours later was approached by two suspects.
> 
> A friend, who saw her on the other side of Raja Gabaglia Avenue, as she was leaving her house to go to the bakery, witnessed the crime. According to the report, the man approached with his gun already drawn and, taking advantage of the fact that Jeane's back was turned, fired the first shot. Even though she was lying on the ground, the shooter continued shooting before fleeing on a motorcycle with his accomplice.
> 
> Jeane was shot in the head. Near the body, the Military Police (PM) collected more than ten large-caliber ammunition shells on Sunday morning. As of this afternoon, the suspects had not yet been located. There are many witnesses, however, according to the military, most say they heard the shots, but did not see the shooter.

Because of this, the authorities believe that the hitmen were targeting Odilia, since the house was her property and was used for the consumption and sale of hallucinogens, but they killed Betsy because she was there by chance.
> 
> The newspaper La Opinión de Cúcuta reported that Odilia's son saw the man who allegedly shot the two people in the living room of his home, but he did not find this suspicious as he had already seen him enter the house on two occasions.
> 
> Authorities reported that the house where the double murder occurred was a so-called “olla” (pot) so they believe the death could have been due to a settlement of scores or revenge.

> On the night of January 13, violence struck LGBTIQ+ people in Colombia again. Diany Ruiz, a trans man who was part of the Magdalena Diversa Foundation, was shot dead at the Ibiza commercial establishment, located in the Villarelis Tercera Escena neighborhood, commune 7, near the 07 de Abril neighborhood of the city of Barrancabermeja . The victim was intercepted by individuals traveling on a motorcycle, who fired several shots that caused serious injuries. Despite medical efforts to save his life, Diany Ruiz was transferred to a health center where he unfortunately died due to the severity of his injuries.
> 
> This is the sixth murder of an LGBTIQ+ person in Colombia in the first 14 days of 2025, according to the Human Rights Observatory of Caribe Afirmativo. This alarming figure reflects the deep dynamics of structural violence that affect our population and demonstrates the urgent need for effective measures to protect the lives and rights of LGBTIQ+ people throughout the country.
> 
> It is imperative that the national government, together with local authorities, implement effective policies and measures to stop this wave of violence. We reiterate the call for a real commitment to justice and respect for human rights, and we urgently call on civil society to collectively demand a country free of violence and discrimination for LGBTIQ+ people.
> 
> It is essential that a rigorous investigation be carried out with a human rights perspective, taking into account the specific risks faced by LGBTIQ+ people in their daily lives, ensuring that the motives for the crime are clarified and justice is achieved in Diany's case. 
> 
> Furthermore, it is urgent to prioritize measures that ensure protection and access to justice for victims of violence, implementing effective prevention strategies that address the particular realities and vulnerabilities of the LGBTIQ+ community, especially trans women, who are in a context of high exposure to violence and discrimination. The implementation of these measures is essential to safeguard the integrity and rights of this historically marginalized population.
> 
> Caribe Afirmativo condemns this new act of violence and express our most sincere condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of Diany Ruiz. This murder is a painful reminder of the lack of guarantees for the life and safety of LGBTIQ+ people in Colombia.

As well as being a passionate speaker and advocate for gender rights, she was the first transgender student to study at Savitribai Phule Pune University.

> Thirty-year-old Sarang Punekar, the first transgender student of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), died by suicide in Rajasthan on Wednesday. Her last rites were performed in Pune on Thursday.
> 
> In Rajasthan, she was living among the transgender community there and worked for them. “We had asked her to come back,” said Pune-based freelance writer Ashwini Satav, who worked with her for a long time.
> 
> Punekar was a strong supporter of the Ambedkarite movement and also raised her voice against NRC and CAA. “Sarang was brilliant in her analysis of caste and power hierarchy. As the first transgender student of the university, her very presence was a unique experience for us, both as academics as well as administrators,” Dr Anagha Tambe, head of the Department of Women’s Studies at SPPU which Punekar had joined in 2018, said. Tambe, while speaking to The Indian Express on Thursday at Punekar’s funeral, felt society at large failed to help Punekar realise her dreams.
> 
> Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sushma Andhare was among those who had gathered to bid farewell to Punekar, who had made a name for herself within a short time as a passionate speaker and advocate for gender rights and other causes. “As a student, Punekar brought about new perspectives to gender studies. She wanted to create knowledge and wanted to do original work about the language and customs of her community. It is our failure as a society that we could not support her dreams,” she said.
> 
> Punekar had worked as a regional coordinator, north Maharashtra, for Pune-headquartered NGO Samyak, which works for women and sexuality. Anand Pawar, executive director of the NGO, said she was first referred to Samyak as an intern but subsequently she was absorbed. “In the development sector it is always the norm to get transgender people to work in HIV prevention programmes. But she broke the stereotype and worked for abortion rights. As the coordinator she executed the project successfully,” he said.
> 
> In the course of her work, she had to coordinate with government officials, doctors and NGOs. The project got over in 2020 and Punekar decided to relocate to Rajasthan. “She said she wanted to be with the community there,” Pawar said.
> 
> Transgender poetess Disha Pinky Sheikh was her professor and personal friend. “She was a very strong voice. Her death marks the end of a very different kind of support for the community,” she said.

> Stephanie Francesca was the woman I loved for eight years and fourteen days whilst she lived; she's also the woman I have continued to love since she died. 
> 
> On the 15th January 2025, Steph took her life in our home. She was 36 years old. 
> 
> She had only been blessed with being her true self for three years before the ignorant, hateful, and nonsensical voices in the world became too much for her to carry - and she didn't deserve to feel that way. No one - cis or trans - deserves to feel that way. To feel hated, simply for breathing. To feel reviled for finally feeling whole, finally feeling joy in being oneself, finally realising who you are and wanting to live your life quietly, in gentle contentment. 
> 
> She was a wonderful gardener. Our house was filled, across the year, with sprouts and flowers and colour - her basket of fire chilis, especially, were absolutely brilliant (if dangerous to those who dared use them). Her hair was the softest, curliest cascade, framing a flawless face with the deepest, darkest eyes. Her laugh was music, sometimes soft and sometimes the most raucous, filthiest thing you could imagine - but always, always contagious. Her smile could've lit cities. Her generosity was constant. She was intelligent, witty, stubborn, incredibly black and white. She was gentle, sharp, a constant curve of dualities and layers. She was human, she was flawed, but those things just made her more real, tangible, significant. And I loved her. 
> 
> Steph was so very many things, to people near and far, but most of all, she was loved. I will love her until I join her, wherever she is, and I'm fairly sure that my love is such that it'll continue even once my body is no longer here to carry it. 
> 
> Stephanie did not deserve to feel that the only option she could stand to live with was one where her life would have to end. She was not the first, and she won't be the last. 

Stephanie was a web developer, and her GitHub account (https://github.com/GrumpyPirate) includes 
an automated Minecraft texture pack compiler  named [Sphaxify](https://github.com/GrumpyPirate/Sphaxify). It also (sadly) includes her [suicide note](https://github.com/GrumpyPirate/suicide-note) - a thoughtful essay makes it very clear that the current climate of hostility and lack of care (including by the NHS) towards trans people had weighed heavily upon her.

They may have died by suicide.

> Blake was a very passionate person dedicated to building community for those around them and worked hard with the Rural Ontario Community of Queer Youth to put on a series of care and wellness workshops and publish a zine of art and writing from rural 2SLGBTQIA+ youth from across the province, a number of whom were their friends. In the summers of their high school years they enjoyed attending 2SLGBTQIA+ summer camps. They were an incredible artist, worked doing theatre production in their hometown of Huntsville, Ontario which led them to pursuing their studies in Theatre Production at Toronto Metropolitan University. They were enrolled in their first year there at the time of their passing. They had a love for the forest, cooking, making art, poetry, and playing stardew valley.


Comments on their obituary posted by those who knew them paint a picture of a inspiring, friendly and creative person whose loss is an absolute tragedy.

> Blake was a wonderful person. We had known each other for a long time, and they inspired me and those around them to be unabashedly themselves. The world was lucky to have them for the period it did, and i will remember them forever. My deepest condolences to their friends and family.

> I worked with Blake - albeit briefly at Starbucks - but they were always fun and amusing. I am absolutely stunned to hear Blake's gone. I fully expected to see Blake at/involved with JC Superstar. I will miss seeing Blake's cheerful and friendly personality come to stock up on Fatface socks. My condolences to Blake's entire family over their loss.

> I was saddened to hear of the loss of such an intelligent, empathetic, creative, mature beyond years, warm and caring person. I taught Blake in grade 6, and they were the kind of student you never forget! Blake, may you shine just as brightly where you have landed, as you did here. Healing thoughts go to Blake’s family and many friends.

> Paula, who was a nurse and physiotherapy student, was at the scene with friends when she got into an argument with the suspect. The reason for the fight was not disclosed by the police.

> Delegate Luiz Carlos Manica reported that there are indications that the crime may have been motivated by hate, considering that Paula was a trans woman.

Her remains were positively identified five days after being found on Friday 31st January.

> The Quapaw Nation Marshal Service sent out a media release on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, stating that on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, stating that on January 31, they responded to a call “regarding the discovery of human remains located near South 565 Road and East 30 Road, north of Commerce in rural Ottawa County, Oklahoma.” The area is about a 40-minute drive from where Aubrey was last seen. 
>
> The Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office responded to the scene and collected the remains, which were brought back to the office for further examination and identification. “Due to the condition of the remains, they appeared to have been at the location for an undetermined period of time,” the release states.
>
> Less than a week after the remains were located, they were positively identified as belonging to Aubrey Dameron. The Marshal Service stated that the family was notified of the identification, and they extended their “sincere condolences to Aubrey’s family and friends as the past six (6) long years of searching for Aubrey has come to an end.” 

Aubrey had gone missing from a small Oklahoma town on 9th March 2019. According to her family, her transition was not well received there:

> GROVE, Ok. — An Indigenous trans woman went missing from a small Oklahoma town in 2019 — her family believes her disappearance resulted from a hate crime. 
>
> News Nation Now reports that Aubrey Dameron, 25, was last seen leaving her family’s Grove, Oklahoma, home at 3:30 a.m. to meet an unnamed person in March of 2019. It has been nearly three years since she has last been seen, yet there are still no substantial leads in the search for Dameron.
>
> The family, a part of the Cherokee Nation, believes her gender identity had something to do with her disappearance. According to the news network, the family said her transition was not received kindly in the small town.
>
> “My immediate thought is that it’s a hate crime. That was my very first thing,” said her uncle.
>
> “Being in Grove. It’s not really diverse whatsoever,” [he] said. “There’s not really a lot of things that go on outside of the ordinary. And once there are, then it’s looked at as abnormal or weird or lacking, for lack of other words.”

Aubrey's death was subsequently ruled a homicide. The Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/MissingAubreyDameron was set up in her memory.

> ""The facts and the circumstances of this crime are beyond depraved,"" Ritts said. ""This is by far the worst homicide investigation that our office has ever been a part of. It is an ongoing investigation, so we are necessarily limited in the things that we can talk about. But no human being should have to endure what Sam endured.""

Ten days later her death was ruled a homicide.

> The homicide of a 25 year old Black trans woman in Tabor, North Carolina on February 19, 2025 came to light after an exhaustive search when her family reported her missing six days prior. Her name was Ervianna “Baydee” Johnson.
> 
> According to BlaqueOut magazine. Ervianna left her home without her phone, keys or belongings at 3:00AM on February 13. This gave her family reason to think she would be back quickly. She did not return so her family began to search for her. On February 16, they filed a missing persons report. Family found Ervianna’s body on Wednesday, Feb 19, 2025. Her body was found near a pond to the south of where she had lived on Bermuda Bay Lane. She was discovered face down without shoes.
> 
> On February 26, police announced that her death was a homicide. The Columbus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) is working with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation They are awaiting final autopsy results.


Ervianna lived with her birth family and worked at a hotel and as a digital content creator. Her social media paints a vivid picture of a woman full of life, which makes her murder even more tragic.
 
> One thing about social media is that she gets to tell her own story – in images, video, memes, words, all of it. She created the unique story of her life. She repeatedly stated that she wanted to go viral. We could try to make that happen as a tribute to her life versus the story of her death alone.
> 
> She liked GloRilla, Rupaul’s Drag Race, and hip-hop majorette competitions. I was definitely impressed with her drop split.
> 
> Most of all, Ervianna’s family fills her social media, especially her nephews and nieces. She celebrated their birthdays, went to their events, and boasted about them. Clearly, she adored them. One of her final videos was celebrating an unexpected snowfall giving her a chance to have a snowball fight with them.
> 
> She was vibrant in so many ways. It is heartrending that those children will grow up without her. It is tragic she won’t grow up.

Unfortunately we don't know anything about her other than the horrific circumstances in which her body was found.

> Bahaghari UP Tacloban expresses its deepest outrage and condemnation over the brutal  murder of Shalani Dolina, a 37-year-old trans woman, whose lifeless body was discovered on February 21 in Brgy. Bagong Silang, Caloocan City. The details emerging from the police investigation are inhumane and deeply disturbing, with reports indicating her severed leg was found heartlessly stored in an ice cooler, while her body was wrapped in a mattress. This gruesome act is not merely a crime; it is a blatant act of violence fueled by hate, prejudice, and a deep-seated disrespect for human life, specifically targeting a member of our vulnerable LGBTQIA+ community.
>
> This heinous crime against Shalani Dolina is an indictment of the systemic discrimination and prevalent dangers faced by the members of LGBTQIA+ community in the country. This tragedy exposes the urgent need of promoting awareness, understanding, and respect for the rights and identities of LGBTQIA+ community. Violence, harassment, and discrimination remain constant threats to the LGBTQIA+ community simply because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression. Standing against such brutality, we remain in steadfast solidarity with Shalani’s family, friends, and loved ones as they mourn this loss. 
>
> We call for an urgent, thorough, and transparent investigation into Shalani’s murder. The perpetrators of this heinous crime must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. We urge authorities to consider the classification of this crime as a hate crime and to prosecute it accordingly, reinforcing the message that violence against LGBTQIA+ individuals has no place in our society. 
>
> The state and the system have repeatedly failed to serve justice for the LGBTQIA+ community, leaving victims of harassment, discrimination, and murder without justice. Time and time again, our existence is denied, our rights ignored—and the long-stalled SOGIESC Equality Bill in Congress is a proof of this neglect the refusal to pass this bill reflects a deep disregard for the safety and dignity of the LGBTQIA+ community. But for as long as we exist, we will continue to resist these injustices.
>
> Bahaghari UP Tacloban remains steadfast in its commitment to advocating for the rights and safety of the LGBTQIA+ community. Shalani’s death should never have happened. It is a painful reflection of the violence and injustice that persist in our society. This is why we remain relentless in our fight for a just, equitable, and inclusive society—one where no one’s life is endangered simply for being who they are.

She had called 911 because she was being held captive and may have been a victim of sex trafficking.

> A trans woman was shot by police at a Pacoima motel last month after she called 911 for help, then [allegedly] approached officers with a knife, according to video footage released Sunday by the Los Angeles Police Department. Linda Becerra Moran, 30, died Feb. 27 after weeks on life support, leaving her friends and community advocates shaken.
> 
> Becerra Moran had told an emergency operator she was being kidnapped in the 10000 block of San Fernando Road on the morning of Feb. 7.
> 
> Footage of the encounter showed officers speaking in Spanish with a distraught Becerra Moran in the moments leading up to the shooting, keeping their guns drawn as she paced inside a motel room and they stood in the doorway. They opened fire after she moved slowly toward them, the video showed.
> 
> Becerra Moran had reported being held against her will in the motel room as a possible victim of sex trafficking, said Soma Snakeoil, executive director of the Sidewalk Project, a Skid Row nonprofit.
> 
> Becerra Moran was hospitalized in grave condition after the shooting, Snakeoil said, and the decision to end life support was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital where she was being treated after attempts to reach family members in her native Ecuador were unsuccessful. The L.A. County Medical Examiner's Office said information about the case remained limited because ""legal next of kin have not been notified."" The LAPD did not acknowledge the death for more than a week.
> 
> Becerra Moran left behind almost no online presence, and mystery surrounds how she ended up at the San Fernando Valley motel where police shot her. Authorities have so far released few additional details about the deadly encounter, including whether they detained Becerra Moran's alleged captor when they arrived.
> 
> In her conversation with a 911 dispatcher, a distraught-sounding Becerra Moran is heard saying that a man in a different room was holding her against her will, and bringing other men into the room.
> 
> ""I swear to you, I have no reason to lie to you. Lord Jesus Christ,"" she is heard sobbing in the phone. ""Are they forcing you to do this?"" the dispatcher asks. ""Yes,"" Becerra Moran responds.
> 
> A dispatcher then put out an alert to Foothill police units about a possible kidnapping and a person who posed a ""danger to herself,"" police said.
> 
> The video released by police shows a group of officers entering the room and asking Becerra Moran to sit on the bed as she shows them a wound she has on the back of the head from getting hit ""many times"" with a bottle. Later, the officer who was examining her head for injuries suggests to his colleagues that the officers should place her on a mental health ""hold.""
> 
> When a supervisor arrives, she becomes upset and demands that they stay away from her, sobbing and yelling at the officers to leave.
> 
> ""No, if you guys were offering to help, I don't want your help,"" she yells at them. ""What's she saying?"" the supervisor asks. She then begins pushing a mini-fridge in their direction, before grabbing a knife and holding it to her neck, prompting officers to draw their weapons.
> 
> When she moved in their direction, Sanchez opened fire, and she fell onto the bed.


Linda was an independently minded devout Catholic who had previously been helped by the Sidewalk Project when she was homeless and fleeing from sexual violence.

> Snakeoil, whose organization offers services for unhoused people, said she first encountered Becerra Moran at MacArthur Park in late 2023, when police were warning about a serial killer who appeared to be targeting homeless people. At the time, Becerra Moran was ""fleeing from sexual violence,"" Snakeoil said, and the organization worked to get her temporarily housed in local motels. But she never stayed in one place for too long, drifting between Westlake and Hollywood.
> 
> Across Los Angeles County, Snakeoil said, shelter beds for female survivors of human trafficking are scarce, especially for those who are trans or who struggle with mental health.
> 
> Kim Soriano, a researcher with the Sidewalk Project, remembers Becerra Moran for her independent-mindedness. ""She was just determined to survive. She was very resilient; like she knew what she wanted and she knew what she liked and what made her comfortable,"" Soriano said, who would run into her while researching her dissertation on police treatment of trans and queer people at MacArthur Park.
> 
> A devout Catholic, Becerra Moran owned a five-pound statuette of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which took up most of the space in the battered suitcase that she lugged around.
> 
> ""She told me that she carried it all around with her and it offered her protection,"" said Soriano. Once, she recalled, Becerra Moran saying of the statuette: ""Be careful with her, because she's come a long way with me.""
> 
> Over the months, the two of them bonded, Soriano said, talking often about Becerra Moran navigating life as a trans woman of color who supported herself as a sex worker while living on the streets. For her, threats were everywhere. Gangs. Drugs. Police.
> 
> Soriano said Becerra Moran was among the park regulars who expressed a grudging acceptance of law enforcement. Like the others, she'd gotten swept up by the seemingly endless cleanups targeting drug use and theft in the area — tents were dismantled, belongings seized and people forced to leave. And yet she ultimately felt police were there for protection, Soriano said.
> 
> ""She called them when she needed help because she was being held hostage and trafficked and they met her with even more violence,"" Soriano said. ""Maybe she did believe that they would be some type of lifeline for her.""
> 
> Becerra Moran had been awarded a housing voucher, but ""no one had placed her anywhere"" given the city's shortage of short-term shelter and housing options, Soriano said. Eventually, with Soriano's help, she secured a bed at an area shelter.
> 
> She didn't stay long. She was frustrated over having some of her possessions thrown away by shelter staff, shortly after moving in, Soriano said. She also recalled Becerra Moran feeling unsafe after being placed in a dorm-style room with three other occupants. When Becerra Moran ended up back on the streets and lost her phone, Soriano fell out of touch. Soriano said she continued doing her outreach at MacArthur Park, hoping to run into Becerra Moran again. She never did.
> 
> Leigh LaChapelle, an associate director at the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, said Becerra Moran's case was a reminder of why police are not the answer to helping trafficking survivors. In recent years, law enforcement authorities have announced stepped-up crackdowns to curb the business along well-known ""tracks.""
> 
> “They see them through the lens of criminality rather than vulnerability and treat them as people who need support,” said LaChapelle. ""I'm so worried about this getting written off as a mistake or as a sort of exception.""
> 
> Snakeoil, of the Sidewalk Project, said that she visited Becerra Moran several times in the hospital, offering up words of encouragement from her bedside — praying that Becerra Moran could hear them from under a tangle of tubes keeping her alive. During the visits, the room remained under guard by two LAPD officers, Snakeoil said.
> 
> At some point, she noticed that Becerra Moran's cherished Virgin of Guadalupe figure was nowhere to be found. A Sidewalk Project worker rushed off to buy a replacement, which Snakeoil placed beside the hospital bed. It remained there as Snakeoil said their goodbyes.
> 
> “We’re angry,"" Snakeoil said. ""This is a vulnerable woman and a survivor of violence.""

Jordan ""JJ"" Maye,17,,photos/2025_03_08_Jordan-JJ-Maye.jpg,https://www.bradfordokeefe.com/obituaries/jordan-maye,thumbnails/2025_03_08_Jordan-JJ-Maye.jpg,8 Mar 2025,,"Ocean Springs, Mississippi",USA,US,30.4049741,-88.831864,suicide,suicide,"JJ died by suicide.

According to her obituary JJ was born in New York and eventually moved to Georgia. She was a city girl at heart and hoped to move back to New York to become a stylist.

> There are many kinds of deaths. The “good death” that we promote in palliative care in which the patient and family are at peace. I see traumatic deaths in the ER, and deaths following weeks of futile ICU care. And then there is suicide. 
> 
> I had never experienced this kind of death up close until March 8. My transgender, mixed race granddaughter, JJ, committed suicide at our daughter's home nearby. JJ was a troubled soul, likely bipolar with oppositional defiant disorder, but under the care of a therapist and psychiatrist. She transitioned as she started her freshman year in high school, and as a family we did everything we could to support her. Gender confirming care is illegal in Mississippi, so her mom, Kera, took her to Louisiana, and when Louisiana outlawed it, she flew JJ to New York to see a physician there. JJ had just been in the psychiatric unit. Her ongoing out of control and dangerous behavior had us at a loss. Many camps and long-term facilities wouldn't take her unless she went as a male. We asked the psychiatrist for a hospital stay at an inpatient unit, and they said it was unnecessary. Three days later, her mom found her. 
> 
> The wailing of a mother who has lost her child is unmistakable, and it was audible from outside Kera’s front door. My husband and I, our other daughter Emilee, and a close family friend held Kera and stood vigil at the house. We all know from crime TV that the coroner must come to the house for a dead body, but on a Sunday morning in a small town it takes a very long time.  A long time for my dead grandchild to be hanging in the garage. A long time for the neighbors to hide the five and ten-year old siblings at their home. A long time waiting for the authorities to take pictures of the house, interview Kera, and take down JJ’s doctor's names. A long time to finally cut her body down and remove her from the house in a body bag. A long time for my husband and I to untie the pink satin sheet and hide it and the step stool from Kera. A long time to look over the suicide notes before the coroner took those away too.  
> 
> In my 30 years of medicine, I have relayed death to a lot of people, but never children that young. Kera, Emilee and my husband couldn't do it, they couldn't get the words out. We brought the kids home from the neighbors, but kids are intuitive and had seen the police cars outside, and their little somber faces as they climbed up onto the couch were heart wrenching. I told them JJ had a sickness, and the doctors tried to help her, and they couldn’t, and she died. Pretty abstract for the five-year-old. Pretty painful for the ten-year-old. Tears and vague explanations followed. And as it approached afternoon, the kids were starving. 
> 
> Kera needed to sleep. The ten-year-old requested Olive Garden. What else do you do when your grandchild commits suicide? Take the other grandchildren out to Olive Garden, of course.  We thought it would be a good distraction anyway. Emilee, my husband and I quickly ordered drinks, and the whole lunch took on a surreal experience. More questions from the kids, multiple texts and phone calls for us to answer. And then social media. Within a day our local Facebook page had posts about JJ. Strangers, talking about MY GRANDCHILD’S DEATH, on social media, speculating about the bullying and blaming the school system for not doing enough. Some people blaming us for not doing enough. Some people blaming us for allowing her to live as a female. Emilee kept Kera’s phone, and I played whack-a-mole with Facebook.  Every time a post came up, I would kindly ask the person to respect our privacy and give us time to grieve. And then another post would pop up.  By Tuesday, Kera made her own announcement and most of the people stopped. We had the funeral to prepare for anyway. 
> 
> A funeral for a 17-year-old is horrific. Picking out an urn, flowers, music, none of it felt real. Fortunately, JJ had been to church with me on Christmas and commented that the pastor was “a cool chick,” so I knew who to ask. And Pastor Betty helped us through it. Kera asked everyone to wear pink, JJ’s favorite. My husband and I worried that given JJ’s issues, no one would come. We were so wrong. Hundreds of people lined up to pay their respects, tell their stories, and we stood there for 2 hours receiving them. She had so much support at school, several teachers had a safe space for her. Other members of the LGBTQ community came by who didn't even know her. And Pastor Betty had a mis speak-instead of asking for a “moment of meditation,” said a “moment of medication,” bringing a moment of levity. Many in the crowd raised their hands to say they needed medication.  
> 
> It still doesn’t seem real. This year is so hard.  The first Mother’s Day, her birthday, her would be senior year of high school. And my husband and I are still mad. Her suicide is really the ultimate f*** you to us, her family, with whom she fought so much. And now it is Pride Month. Really, Pride month is just about being kind to all people, but why shouldn't all humans be like that every day and not just in June? In her suicide note JJ asked us to tell her story.  Kera spoke at our local Pride festival last week. And this is JJ’s  story.

> The Public Prosecutor's Office of Monza has launched an investigation into the tragic death of Davide Garufo, the 21-year-old known on TikTok, who died on March 19 in [their] home in Sesto San Giovanni, in the province of Milan.
>
> The investigation, coordinated by the prosecutor Claudio Gittardi, focuses on two hypotheses of crime: failure to store a firearm and incitement to suicide. According to what has emerged so far, the investigation is not connected to the content published on social media by the young [person], where [they] had courageously shared [their] journey of gender transition.
> 
> Since 2020, Davide had begun to publish ironic and light-hearted content on TikTok, and then opened up more and more to [their] personal sphere.

> 
> It is precisely at this stage that [their] social profiles have been the target of numerous offensive and violent comments, currently being examined by investigators. Many users have contributed to a hostile climate, with episodes that could constitute online bullying and transphobia .
> 
> According to Sinistra Italiana, Davide did not take [their] own life by individual choice, but was pushed towards suicide by a society that denies and humiliates the identity of transgender and non-binary people. The delegate for rights of Sinistra Italiana Milano, Daniele Durante, declared: ""I do not consider Alex's (Davide) death a suicide, but a murder with those responsible: a traditionalist, selfish society, and an intolerant culture that strikes those who simply want to be themselves"".
> 
> In its statement, Sinistra Italiana expressed closeness to Davide's family, friends and followers , underlining the young man's courage in coming out as a transgender woman, announcing the start of hormone therapy and asking to be called Alexandra. The party finally reiterated its commitment to counter transphobic hatred , promoting a culture of respect and inclusion. The declared objective is to build a more just and free society, through a strong legislative initiative in collaboration with LGBTQIA+ organizations.

> ROCHESTER, N.Y. – Nearly three weeks have passed since Katelyn Rinetta Benoit, a transgender student at the School of the Arts, took her own life.
> 
> On Sunday, dozens from the LGBTQ+ community gathered for a vigil to honor her memory at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester.
> 
> “We’re here to celebrate the life of our community member, our youth, our siblings,” said Brittan Hardgers, president of Next Generation Men of Transition, one of the vigil’s organizers.
> 
> Hardgers, a transgender man, expressed his sorrow over another prominent death in the trans community, referencing the recent killing of transgender man Sam Nordquist in Canandaigua.
> 
> “It’s painful. It continues to happen,” Hardgers said. “It reminded me of Sam. It reminded me of just the hostile attacks that are against the trans community.”
> 
> Parents of transgender children also emphasized the need for change. “My kid would tell you that I was their first bully and now I am their biggest champion,” said a local advocate, a parent of a transgender child. “So it really goes back to filling the needs that the kids have.”
> 
> A petition is currently circulating to urge the Rochester City School District to better protect transgender and LGBTQ+ students.


Unlike those of far too many young trans people, Katelyn's obituary is respectful. It paints a picture of a joyful and creative trans teenager who was struggling with bullying and eating disorders, and her loss is obviously keenly felt in her community.

> We remember Katelyn, who left us too soon. A teenager with a passion for writing, computer games, music, gardening, and baking, she searched for happiness through creative outlets. Kat also immensely enjoyed the art of fashion and thrifting as well as “borrowing” clothes from her mother to create new outfits.
> 
> Katelyn faced the challenges of depression, bullying, and eating disorders while bravely living as a transgender young woman, always striving to be true to herself despite the difficulties she encountered.
> 
> Katelyn’s life was marked by both joy in her creative passions and the struggle of living with depression.
> 
> As we grieve her loss, we also honor her strength and authenticity. Katelyn’s memory is a reminder of the challenges many young people face and the importance of supporting one another in times of need. We will always remember her for her irreplaceable smile and laugh, her unique sense of humor, her huge and generous heart, and the impact she has had on those around her.

> Activists and members of the LGBTI+ community in Antioquia are mourning the shocking crime that took the life of Sara ""la Millerey,"" as her friends knew her, in early April 2025.
> 
> According to reports shared on social media, Sara's arms and legs were broken before she was thrown into the Playa Rica ravine in the municipality of Bello.
> 
> On social media, family and friends lamented the news after her death was confirmed on Sunday afternoon, April 6.
> 
> Sara's final hours were the stuff of horror films. Her attackers, not content with just beating her, decided to immobilize her to prevent her from escaping a deadly trap in which, despite her pleas, she ended up losing her way .


The investigation into Sara's murder revealed that at least seven individuals were involved. A reward of up to 100 million pesos has been offered for information on her killers.

One, Juan Camilo Muñoz Gaviria, (also known as ""Teta"") was detained on 30th April on charges of aggravated homicide and torture.

> The Attorney General's Office revealed that at least seven people were allegedly involved in the murder of transgender woman Sara Millerey González, who was brutally murdered on April 4 in the municipality of Bello, Antioquia.
> 
> So far, only one person has been arrested in connection with these incidents, but authorities assure that the investigation remains active and more arrests could be made in the coming days.
> 
> The first person arrested in this case was identified as Juan Camilo Muñoz Gaviria, alias Teta, who was detained on April 30 during a joint operation between the Prosecutor's Office and the National Police. Read: One of the suspects in the brutal murder of Sara Millerey arrested.
> 
> This Friday, May 2, during the indictment hearing, the prosecution maintained that there was evidence indicating that the crime was not committed alone.
> 
> According to the victim's family attorney, Saúl León, a second person has already been identified, and the involvement of at least six individuals in the murder is being investigated. ""There is evidence that prior to the physical assault, she was also verbally abused because of her gender,"" León said in an interview with Noticias Caracol, warning of a possible element of hate linked to Sara's gender identity.


Sara's funeral took place on 8th April. She was described as a happy, joyful and kind-hearted by those who knew her.

She had graduated in 2017, had a strong faith and loved to write.

> Happy, joyful, kind-hearted—those are just a few of the adjectives that best described Sara Millerey González Borja, the trans woman brutally murdered in a river in the municipality of Bello, Antioquia. 
> 
> Sandra Milena Borja, Sara's mother, is navigating these days in a kind of ""sea"" of memories. Surrounded by picture frames containing her daughter's best postcards, Sandra delves into memory to bring her beloved daughter's life back to the present.
> 
> “This is her graduation photo. It was in 2017. She was a girl who loved to write. Very devoted to God. These are the little photos of her I remember,” she says, with that sadness that only mothers feel when they lose a child. It's that absolute desolation and sadness that parents feel when the premise that says they, the children, are responsible for burying their parents, and not the other way around, is shattered.
> 
>  “This was on a birthday,” she adds, holding back tears. “She was very cheerful, very happy. She liked to write about God and the Virgin Mary. I have some writings here, if you want, I can show them to you,”  she tells RED+ NOTICIAS journalist Maicol Buitrago, who in his interview delved into the notebooks containing Sara's unpublished letters and writings, a previously unknown side of the trans woman the entire country is talking about today.
> 
> The texts reveal the other Sara. The Sara who dedicated a few hours of her time to writing letters addressed to God, to the Virgin Mary, and to life, using a black pen, the kind that leaves your fingers stained with ink.
> 
> ""Lord Jesus Christ, please keep my home free from all evil at every moment, hour, minute, and second. Keep me away from tragic and painful situations. May I never fall into evil, much less be trapped.""
> 
> -- excerpt from a letter by Sara Millerey González


In Sara's final diary entry she wrote that she had been threatened and was afraid:

> Sara Millerey's mother, shared with Noticias Caracol the last message her daughter left in her diary. She wrote that she was afraid, afraid of what might happen to her, and that she wished to be healed, both body and soul.
> 
> ""You know I've been through a lot of fear and a lot of threats, which I wouldn't want to come true. Please, I ask you not to let them happen,"" her mother told the aforementioned media outlet.
> 
> Her mother also showed a leaflet that read: “Bring me light. Bathe me in light. Heal my body. Heal my heart. Heal my soul.” She added that her daughter was afraid to go out because she would be attacked or insulted, “but she didn't tell me anything beyond that so I wouldn't worry, because she was a person who didn't harm anyone, anyone. Everyone knew her.”

After Sara's death a mural in her honour was painted near Solla on the Medellín-Bogotá highway.

The mural depicts Sara wearing a blue dress, with 1993 (the year she was born) and 2025 set against the colors of the Pride flag. On the mural is the caption ""Hate is killing us"".

She had fled to Abidjan in 2021 after fleeing from Benin, where she had been assaulted in a bar and stripped naked in public.

> Jennifer, age 23, had been living in Ivory Coast for four years after fleeing her native Benin after she was assaulted in a bar there and stripped naked in public. Since 2021, she had thought she had found a relative haven of peace in Ivory Coast, where she could enjoy her trans identity in peace, far from the inquisitive eyes of her family.
> 
> Until recently, Ivory Coast had been seen as relatively tolerant towards LGBT people, but that image has been shattered by a wave of anti-LGBT hate speech and violence.
> 
> According to those close to Jennifer, she apparently met her murderer on a social network, but had taken precautions before meeting him. She told him beforehand that she was a trans woman in order to avoid any misunderstanding.
> 
> She also avoided going out at night to meet him in an unfamiliar neighborhood. Instead, she arranged to meet him at her home. However, on the night of April 4-5, she was found lifeless in her home, stabbed to death and lying in a pool of blood.
> 
> Before the tragedy, feeling the need to be proactive, she had taken care to send close friends a photo of the young man she was about to meet. As a result, after the murder, the identity of her assailant was quickly revealed on the web.

> Asociación Silueta X, a member of Federación Ecuatoriana de Organizaciones LGBTI+, denounces with profound indignation and pain the brutal murder of a trans woman, whom we will refer to by the pseudonym Valeria, to protect her identity and dignity. This crime, which occurred on the night of April 15, 2025, on calles 40 and K, near the Emilio Murillo school, in the suburb of Guayaquil, constitutes a transfemicide that demonstrates the systematic violence against trans people in Ecuador.
> 
> According to the information gathered, Valeria was shot and killed by gunmen who arrived on a motorcycle and fired a volley of bullets at her. This act of extreme violence not only took her life but also reflects the hatred and intolerance toward diverse gender identities. Furthermore, we deeply regret that, in initial reports, Valeria's gender identity was violated by referring to her in the masculine, perpetuating a form of revictimization that denies her existence as a trans woman.

> A Thai [trans woman] [died by] suicide in her parked car outside her barbecue restaurant in Nonthaburi province, near Bangkok, after reportedly losing over 7 million baht in an investment scam.
> 
> A worker at the restaurant in Bang Kruai district noticed the vehicle belonging to his transgender employer, Sarut, parked outside unusually early on the morning of April 24. He became suspicious, as she had never arrived that early before.
> 
> The staff searched the premises but found no sign of Sarut. Initially, they dismissed the matter until receiving a phone call from her older brother, who reported her missing. The worker then rushed to check inside the car and discovered her lifeless body, subsequently notifying Bang Kruai Police Station.
> 
> Rescue personnel and a medical team from the Institute of Forensic Medicine reported that the transwoman was found dead in the driver’s seat of her white GWM Haval SUV. There were no visible wounds or signs of a struggle. She was believed to have died approximately eight to ten hours before discovery.
> 
> A close friend told Channel 7 that Sarut was a kind and generous person, well-liked in the community. She was known for her friendliness and for regularly feeding stray cats in the area.
> 
> The friend added that Sarut had repeatedly spoken about her financial struggles. They last met on the night before her death.
> 
> Following interviews with other friends and family members, police learned that the [trans woman] had lost over 7 million baht in an investment scam. She did not only spend her life savings on the fraudulent scheme but also borrowed significant sums from others to fund what turned out to be a fake business.
> 
> Creditors reportedly confronted her several times, demanding repayment, adding to her stress. Sarut often told her friends that she wanted to end her life to escape the situation, though none believed she would act on it.
> 
> Police reviewed the restaurant’s CCTV footage and discovered that Sarut unplugged all the cameras before taking her own life in the car.

> Her name was Kelsey Elem. She was 25 years old when her boyfriend killed her after an argument. They both lived in St. Louis.
> 
> St. Louis County Police reported an altercation broke out in the 5800 block of Grace Avenue between Kelsey and her partner, Martino Lewis. Reportedly, an eyewitness overheard an argument. Elem’s family said that it escalated into the man they call ‘Tino’ punching Elem so badly in the mouth that she started bleeding.
> 
> According to KSDK, documents from the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said Elem was afraid Lewis was going to get her gun and asked a witness to call police. While the witness was on the phone with 911, they heard a gunshot and saw Lewis run out of the house to drive away in Elem’s car. 
> 
> Police charged Lewis with second degree murder, armed criminal action and domestic assault.
> 
> Her family had to clean out her apartment, describing harrowing details. It seems like a terrifying violent attack.
> 
> Kelsey was born in Atlanta. Her family relocated to St. Louis where Kelsey attended East St. Louis High School, then studied at Duke University. She worked retail at Hollister and then moved into food service as a manager at McDonalds. She did some training to become a medical assistant. Her Facebook posts reiterate her work ethic – she typically had two jobs, bought her own car and set up her own apartment at age 18.
> 
> Her birthday was November 5. Family said she was an advocate for the transgender community and was a consistent friend to strangers. 
> 
> The day before her death, Kelsey posted a heart wrenching tribute to her transition.

> She didn’t know that might be her last post, but it is a humbling tribute to the resiliency and self-awareness of this young woman. I’m still not sure if its a comfort that she gets to have the final say, however unintentional. It is heartbreaking that her final words came at such a young age.

> She deserved to be loved by someone who would respect and value her.

Lucy Fox,46,,photos/2025_05_25_Lucy-Fox.jpg,email,thumbnails/2025_05_25_Lucy-Fox.jpg,25 Apr 2025,,"Hartlepool, Durham",United Kingdom,GB,54.69133796,-1.21311919,uncategorised,not reported,"Lucy passed away several weeks after suffering a brutal transphobic assault outside her home. A day before the attack on Lucy her partner Katy had also been attacked.

> Lucy-Anne Fox passed away, aged 46, on April the 25th 2025. Lucy was a fantastic cook and had been a celebrated Italian chef. She loved video games, fantasy books, the moon, the ocean, and her cats. Her favourite flowers were orchids, and her favourite ice cream flavour was cookie dough. She could do an excellent Mickie Mouse impression. She was always giving, fiercely protective of her friends and community, and endlessly funny.

*[Editor's Note: An anecdotal second hand report from a friend (quoted below) suggests Lucy died by suicide. However, as what happened to her is the subject of an investigation and her partner has been advised not to comment on the circumstances the case has been recorded here as ""Uncategorised"" pending the results of the investigation]*


A GoFundMe set up by a friend to fundraise for medical, therapy, security and moving expenses for Lucy and her partner Katy makes harrowing reading:

> Earlier this month, my two best friends were attacked, each in separate incidences.
> 
> First, Katy was held at knifepoint on the streets in broad daylight in an attempted robbery. They managed to come away physically unharmed, though obviously shaken. The man was eventually arrested and was charged with attempted robbery and unlawful possession of a bladed article (a Stanley knife), plus two other attempted robberies, causing criminal damage to windows, and stealing a pedal cycle. Any news articles about the incident also misgendered Katy.
> 
> The next day, my friend Lucy, Katy’s wife, was subjected to a violent, degrading, and transphobic attack right outside her own home. She was chased by a group of men, physically assaulted, undressed against her will, and subjected to transphobic slurs while they laughed. The attack left her with serious injuries, including to her head, back, and knees, and chunks of her hair were ripped out.
> 
> Police were called, though the three culprits had already fled. Upon arrival, Lucy approached the responding officer, expecting to start telling him what happened. But instead of being rescued from the hate crimes committed against her, Lucy had an extremely distressing interaction with a responding police officer, which resulted in further physical pain, public humiliation, and emotional distress. After this interaction with the officer, the officer then interacted with Katy in a way that they experienced as hostile, dishonest, and ableist. Lucy and Katy believe that the officer was so hostile because she is a disabled and vulnerable trans woman.
> 
> I sat on video call with them that night, Lucy sitting broken and in pain. Her memory barely lasted a minute at a time. It was terrifying seeing her in this state, seeing what had been done to her and what saying effects this will have on both her and Katy. Any sound from the street or car that pulled up had her in a panic, thinking the men may have returned. Katy and I pleaded with her to go to the hospital, but Lucy felt she couldn’t trust another emergency service, not after she felt she had fallen victim to the last one.
> 
> The next morning, Lucy collapsed. An ambulance was called and Lucy was taken to hospital. At A&E, it was discovered that Lucy had multiple head injuries, evidence of a dislocated shoulder and torn muscles in her shoulder and bicep, bruises on her back, and torn and bloody knees. As I sit here writing this, her knees still carry the scabs and scars of the attack.
> 
> The following weeks felt like a living nightmare for Katy and Lucy. They are terrified to leave the house, anxious anytime someone came to the door, and still recovering mentally, physically, and emotionally. Lucy especially is experiencing lasting issues with memory and ongoing pain from her experiences.

Fu Tongyuan, 42, was apprehended by police at Suvarnabhumi Airport.

> PATTAYA — A 42-year-old Chinese national, Mr. Fu Tongyuan, wanted for the gruesome murder of a 25-year-old Thai transgender woman, was apprehended by Immigration police at Suvarnabhumi Airport on Saturday afternoon. The suspect, whose face was covered with scratch marks, was transported back to Pattaya for interrogation.
> 
> The victim’s body was discovered in a rental apartment in Soi Arunothai, Central Pattaya. The deceased, identified as Woranand from Nong Khai province, had suffered horrific injuries. Her body had been cut open from neck to genitals, with her lung missing and heart removed from the body.
> 
> Investigators found a large plastic bag and scissors inside the apartment. The bathroom showed signs of thorough cleaning, with almost no blood stains remaining. Forensic police conducted detailed examinations and collected DNA evidence from the crime scene.
> 
> The apartment housekeeper told police that around 2 AM, she heard an argument between a Chinese man and a transgender woman in the room. She later heard the transgender woman screaming, “Let me go! Don’t hurt me!” This was followed by the sound of footsteps and repeated door kicking that continued for about an hour before falling silent.
> 
> When she woke up in the morning, the housekeeper reported the incident to her employer, who instructed her to knock on the door and warn the tenant. When no one answered, they used a spare key to enter the room, where they discovered the transgender woman’s body lying in a pool of blood. The Chinese man had disappeared. They immediately called the police.
> 
> The apartment manager revealed that the Chinese suspect had rented the room around 9 AM on April 25 for a one-week stay. According to his passport, he had previously visited Thailand 2-3 times as a tourist.
> 
> The suspect was finally arrested at approximately 1:45 PM while attempting to clear immigration at Suvarnabhumi Airport. He was preparing to leave the country on China Eastern Airlines flight MU 742 bound for Kunming, China.


Woranun’s parents, from her home province of Nong Khai, described her as their family’s breadwinner, and said that she sent home around $300 USD each month to support them.

I saw her the day before she died, she was walking down the road and I was on the bus. I waved but wasn't sure if she saw me.""


***Remembering Lesley Storm***

> Lesley Storm legally changed her name in August 2010 and had gender confirmation surgery in January 2014 in Brighton. She began performing poetry in 2015 and became quickly known to many in Edinburgh’s writing and publishing community, becoming a regular at the monthly The Heretics meeting. 
> 
> This revived poetry and song collective, started in 1970 by Dolina MacLennan, Liz Lochhead, Robert Garioch, John Herdman, Sorley MacLean, and others, proved an incredibly welcoming launching ground for Lesley as a writer. Her work was always powerful, personal, and as well as occasionally commenting specifically on life as a trans woman, most of Lesley’s poetry concerned the most human of emotions of all — love, loss, grief, joy. All of these emotions Lesley mastered as a writer and presented memorably in her poetry.
> 
> From this huge burst of creativity Lesley produced a strong first and only collection, **It’s About Time**, published in 2021, which although she and her publisher were not aware at the time, was likely the first full collection of poetry by a transgender person in Scotland.
> 
> Lesley was incredibly supportive to many writers, and despite life long depression was usually hilarious company, caustic, critical, gentle as well as understanding, particularly of those in any way marginalised. She thought Brexit was Bollocks and that Boris was the anti-Christ. She wrote poetry constantly and collected poetry books, and has left a mountain of unpublished work.
> 
> Lesley died peacefully at home on 28th April 2025. We believe Lesley’s birth date was 1951 – 1953.


Lesley's Instagram profile is https://www.instagram.com/leithlesley/. In her own words:
  
> ""I’m a woman. I support them. I’m bisexual. I support them. I’m a feminist. I support them. I endure regular abuse for being trans. I support them. I am called a “poof” by the unenlightened. I support them. My name is Lesley, and I'm a woman - that is to say that I am human, just like you, and you like me.""

She was a cook at CasaNem - a shelter for vulnerable LGBTQIA+ people.

> Trans activist Dannielly Rocha, 38, was murdered in the early hours of Friday (2), in the Lapa neighborhood, in downtown Rio de Janeiro. A cook at CasaNem — a shelter for vulnerable LGBTQIA+ people — Danny, as she was known by friends and colleagues, was found dead at home after being seen with an as-yet-unidentified man. The case caused great commotion and reignited debates about violence against trans people in Brazil.
> 
> State deputy Dani Balbi (PCdoB), the first trans woman elected to the position in Rio, was one of the first to release the news, based on images from the Military Police. In a post on social media, she demanded answers: “She entered the house accompanied by a man who, hours later, left alone. After that, Danny was found dead. It is unacceptable. It is urgent. We want a serious investigation. With every trans woman murdered, it is the State that fails,” she wrote.
> 
> Manoela Menandro, a close friend of Danny, told Agência Brasil that she arrived at the crime scene shortly after the incident and saw the police moving around. A neighbor confirmed that he saw the activist enter her home accompanied by an unknown man, who left shortly after. Security cameras at a tire shop recorded the moment the suspect left the place discreetly and apparently nervously, putting something in his pocket — possibly the victim's cell phone, according to Manoela.
> 
> The friendship between Manoela and Danny lasted about a decade. She emotionally described the relationship as that of mother and daughter. “Dannielly was like a mother. She took care of me, Ana Luísa, made our food, took care of our animals, cleaned the house. She was everything to us,” she said. According to Manoela, her friend was a generous, cheerful person who was willing to help anyone around her.

> Danny's body remains at the Rio de Janeiro Institute of Forensic Medicine (IML) and, according to family members, it should be released in the next few days. Meanwhile, friends, members of parliament and organizations are demanding a speedy investigation and justice for the death of the activist, who dedicated her life to supporting other LGBTQIA+ people at risk of social exclusion.
> 
> CasaNem, where Danny worked, was founded in 2015 and is a reference in the shelter of LGBTQIA+ people who have been expelled from their homes or are victims of violence. According to Antra (National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals), Brazil continues to lead the world ranking of murders of trans people: there were 122 victims in 2024, 95% of whom were transvestites or trans women. Danny's death adds to this cruel statistic, reinforcing the urgency of public policies aimed at protecting the trans population.

It is part of a serious and growing wave of structural violence faced by the transgender population in Ecuador, marked by hatred, discrimination, and impunity. Based on our observations and community data collection, we warn that there is an underreporting of gender-based crimes due to the lack of specific classifications in the judicial system and the lack of effective action by state institutions.

The victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition, where [he] later died from [his] injuries. Original reporting, while limited, too often misgenders Shy’Parius.
> 
> There is very little information about this shooting. I hope greater visibility in the LGBTQ community will help.

> A Memphis nativee, Shy’Parius worked at Fedex, as a youth counselor with Youth Villages, and as a shift manager at Save A Lot. He attended Sheffield High School. He has also attended Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts.
> 
> Shy’Parius was 32 years old, born on September 9. He had multiple side hustles as a bartender, cook, and operating a small store with his wife.
> 
> He and his wife just celebrated their daughter’s 12th birthday. They also parented a son. In February, Shy’Parius celebrated his third wedding anniversary with his wife, Lola.
> 
> Shy’Parius loved his dog, Bella. As I looked at his social media content, I noticed he consistently shared content about kids in need – missing children, requests to help pay school lunch debt, etc. It is easy to say “that’s sad” when you come across that content, but for him to take the effort to keep sharing it says a lot about his concern for child welfare.
> 
> Family and friends held a a candle light vigil Saturday May 24, 2025 at 6pm at MLK Riverside Park. His funeral will be Tuesday May 27th at R.S. Lewis Funeral Home.

Marcial Eustaquio Paucara Cora,48,,,,trans_flag.jpg,18 May 2025,,Tacna,Peru,PE,-18.0026827,-70.2770047,violence,asphyxiated,"Marcial was found dead in a hotel after being seen entering with an unidentified man.

> A gruesome incident has sent shockwaves through the city of Tacna. Recently, a transgender woman was found dead inside a hostel after entering the establishment with a mysterious man. Shortly after the discovery, the cause of her death was revealed, and all indications point to a homicide committed by her companion.
> 
> According to initial reports, the incident occurred in the morning hours of Sunday, May 18, at the Los 5 Titos hotel, located at the intersection of calles Arias and Aragüez. Under these circumstances, Marcial Eustaquio Paucara Cora (48), a transgender person, got out of a taxi accompanied by a man wearing a mustard jacket and carrying a white bag.
> 
> The two then entered the hotel and went to one of the rooms. The hotel's security cameras captured every movement of Paucara Cora and her companion. After more than two hours, the suspect left the room, behaving suspiciously, and quickly left the property.
> 
> As night fell, the quartermaster approached the bedroom. After knocking several times and receiving no response, he entered, discovering a truly terrifying scene: the trans woman was lying in bed, her face lifeless.
> 
> Alerted by what he had found, he immediately called the authorities. Shortly after, police officers and forensic experts arrived at the hostel and proceeded with the necessary investigation. In the room, they found liquor bottles and other supplies that the occupants had allegedly consumed. A prosecutor later ordered the removal of the body.
> 
> Among the initial findings obtained by the regional morgue, it was learned that the autopsy performed on Marcial Paucara's body revealed the causes of her unfortunate death. The report established that her death was the result of mechanical asphyxiation due to compression of the upper respiratory tract, thus confirming that this was a murder.
> 
> For this reason, the police are evaluating camera footage to track down the possible whereabouts of the man who fled, as he is currently the prime suspect in the crime. The Public Prosecutor's Office has begun the necessary investigation to locate him.
> 
> Relatives of the trans woman, who was found dead at the hostel where she was staying, expressed their grief over what happened. ""She was a lonely person, with no problems with anyone,"" said one of her sisters, who also demanded justice and the full force of the law for whoever is responsible for this crime.

At the time she was killed Catalina was starting to work as a taxi driver. As she had received a call from a client to pick him up where she was murdered it is reasonable to suggest that this client was implicated in her murder.

> As for the reason they came to that bus stop, located at the entrance to La Ceiba in Orotina, Doña Gabriela explained that it was because Catalina was working as an informal taxi driver, using a car she had recently purchased on credit, and had received a call from a client who asked her to pick her up there.
> 
> ""Then she came by the house and called me. She said, 'Mommy, can you go with me on a trip to Cebadilla?' Because she didn't have a license and I did. So I told her it was okay and I went with her,"" the woman said.
> 
> Once there, Catalina parked her car and got out while talking on the phone with the alleged client. At that moment, she was intercepted by the two gunmen who shot her.
> 
> Doña Gabriela said they need a lot of help right now to say their final goodbyes to Catalina, so any donation will be a blessing to her family.

> ""It is with heavy hearts and profound sadness that we share the passing of Charlotte Fosgate, a 17-year-old from Oak Grove, Oregon, who left this world on May 2, 2025. She [suicide method redacted] to commit suicide.
> 
> ""Charlotte was a vibrant and creative teenager navigating life as a transgender girl in a world that too often failed to show her the kindness she so deeply deserved. She was last seen on the evening of May 1 and reported missing soon after. Her final public messages, posted the next morning, offered a heartbreaking farewell from a high bridge—an image that now haunts everyone who knew and cared for her.
> 
> ""Charlotte’s tweets, which quietly said goodbye—'it’s a pretty view' and 'long way down'—were viewed millions of times in the hours after her death. But what should have been a space for grief and remembrance became a mirror of society’s cruelty. The response from parts of the internet was callous, transphobic, and dehumanizing—a tragedy in its own right.
> 
> ""But Charlotte was not a joke. She was not content. She was a child—a daughter, a friend, a soul in pain who still smiled, still shared jokes, still had dreams. She loved art, music, and expressing herself online in the only ways she felt safe. Charlotte had so much left to do, so much left to say, and so much love left to give.
> 
> ""Charlotte lived in a world where being different often meant being targeted. She lived in a society that criminalized her identity and vilified her truth. Yet through all of that, she dared to be herself. That, in itself, was an act of courage.
> 
> ""Her death is not just a personal loss, but a societal failure—a reminder of the urgent need for compassion, mental health care, and safety for transgender youth. According to national data, transgender teens like Charlotte face staggering rates of depression, rejection, and suicide. But none of it is inevitable. Every life lost is one we could have saved.""


Charlotte was a active member of the modding community. A member of her community wrote the following tribute, which paints a picture of a creative young woman whose loss makes us all so much poorer:

> Charlotte/Burntfishe/Charcoal: An amazing modder and friend of who I miss very much
> 
> First off: I always saw charcoal as an amazing friend. We worked together many times and every time we did she was one of my favourite people to work with. > Charlotte will always be remembered by everyone as one of the best to ever do it. No hate towards her will be tolerated.
> 
> Charlotte's first mod was published on January 23rd, being a port of Emerald Coast from Sonic Adventure.
> 
> Charlotte would go on to make many of the most popular, creative, and purely fun mods the community has ever seen. We continued to stay in touch, offer advice to each other, and I'd definitely recommend giving all these mods a go. They're great fun and a product of her talent.
> 
> She also selflessly offered her contribution, help, advice, and guidance to many modders both new and veteran. Her real contributions goes way beyond this, but these are notable examples.
> 
> I will always remember Charlotte as an amazing friend and someone who boosted the whole community during a crucial growing stage. The HE2 level modding community would be nowhere near as vibrant and healthy if it wasn't for her efforts. I feel so privileged that I got to work with Charlotte and be a recipient of her kindness and be her friend. She was taken way too soon and nobody should ever have to endure what she did.
> 
> She always made us smile and laugh and was the best person we could ever ask for. Charlotte Fosgate, you'll be missed dearly by us all.

He died defending his partner, a trans man, from a homophobic attack.

Initially police claimed that his murder was not a hate crime, but after widespread outrage they retracted that claim.

> The husband of Jonathan Joss, the “King of the Hill” actor fatally shot by a neighbor in San Antonio, thanked Joss for saving his life in the Sunday altercation. He explained that the actor, whom he had just married on Valentine’s Day, pushed him out of the line of fire at the site of their former home, which had burned down following repeated threats.
> 
> “[The neighbor] started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired. Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side-by-side. When the man fired, Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life,” Tristan Kern de Gonzales wrote in a Facebook post on Monday.
> 
> Joss’ neighbor, identified as Sigfredo Alvarez-Cega, was arrested a block away. Alvarez-Cega, who reportedly got into a heated argument with Joss before killing him, has been charged with murder.
> 
> De Gonzales explained that before the neighbor with the gun appeared, they were horrified to discover “the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw,” he said.
> 
> “He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other. I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved,” de Gonzales wrote.
> 
> He also explained that during the two years he and Joss had lived at the site, that “people in the area … repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.”
> 
> He added that they were “harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship” from people who were “openly homophobic.” De Gonzales said that he and Joss were still newlyweds who were looking for a trailer and “planning our future.”
> 
> He thanked Joss’ friends and fans, concluding his post with, “My focus now is on protecting Jonathan’s legacy and honoring the life we built together … Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built.”

> ""Tessa was a gentle and kind soul, who loved to read and had aspirations to become a published author someday. She cared deeply about those around her, and the world at large, and was always willing to help out any way she was able. She enjoyed traveling and good food, was especially fond of cats, and spending time online, gaming and chatting with her friends. She had a love for eclectic music, complex and thought provoking stories, took joy in simple and lovely things, and was incredibly intelligent and hardworking. She enjoyed kayaking and spending time in nature, and just being in the presence of loved ones on a regular basis.""
> 
> She was nearly 22, and had been doing her best to manage her Major Depressive Disorder with PTSD (she was bullied all throughout school, and dealt with the struggles of low support needs autism). She had also been dealing with severe gender dysphoria since age 17, and had just started medically/physically transitioning last August. She was seeing a regular trans friendly therapist and taking her meds as directed, and was always open with her father and I when things were getting bad. In the last month prior to her suicide, she had expressed fears about staying in the States, had some high school friends reject her identity and cut her off, suddenly lost her beloved cat, and in hindsight, I genuinely think her meds were also a significant factor in acting on her ideation. I didn't know exactly what she was taking since she was an adult and all, but now that I do, there were a few members of her biological family that had really bad suicidal ideation and mental breaks while on the same medication.
>
> She must have had a moment of crisis while at home by herself, took all of her meds, and by the time we found her that afternoon, they had ravaged her system. The emergency staff did absolutely everything to save her, but to no avail. We were there beside her right through the end.
> 
> Her name was Tessa June. She died on June 4th, 2025. 
> 
> We don't hold any harsh judgments of her for what happened; I feel like she wasn't even herself in the moment. Her father and I take solace in knowing that she felt safe and supported here at home to be her true self, but there are still so many ""should have could have"" thoughts that will plague our minds from now on, I'm afraid. We miss her like hell, and I don't think I'll ever be the same without her here.

Before being hit she had reportedly been sitting on the central divider.

It is not known whether her death was accidental or intentional.

> Hope Lyca Youngblood was 49 years old when she was killed in vehicular incident in Los Angeles on June 7, 2025. Hope identified as a trans woman.
> 
> ""[They were] struck and killed Saturday by multiple vehicles near a freeway offramp to the Santa Monica (10) Freeway in the Palms community of Los Angeles, authorities said. The crash occurred about 6:10 a.m. on the eastbound freeway, at the La Cienega Boulevard offramp, according to the California Highway Patrol. The victim, who was wearing a black shirt and blue shorts, had been sitting on top of the center divider. They were struck by multiple vehicles"", the CHP said.
> 
> Sadly, reporting in Los Angeles misgendered Hope. Her family does not.
> 
> I’ve been mulling over Hope’s death – clearly violent, but was it an accident? I came across the California Highway Patrol’s log of that morning. It seems conflicting reports on whether Hope was trying to cross the highway or standing on the divider, or perhaps both? It does suggest one vehicle who struck her stopped to call first responders, remaining on the scene. So that driver didn’t commit a criminal act, but what about the others of the “multiple vehicles” - did they stop? Does it matter?
> 
> Yes, it matters. When you hit a human body with your car, you stop. You answer questions. You learn the name of the person so you can carry them forward with you when you are next behind the wheel.
> 
> And now maybe you find out how to get someone sitting on a divider safely across the road.


Hope was originally from Mayfield, Kentucky. Her brother paints a vivid picture of a person who was incredibly creative and proud of her trans identity:

> “She was an avid record collector, a talented visual artist and writer, an absolute shredder on guitar, a cigar connoisseur, and a proud trans woman. We ask that you respect Hope’s name and pronouns. Her trans identity was one of the few things that brought her joy and peace in the last few years. We will make another announcement when funeral arrangements have been arranged.”

Hope had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and manic depression at the age of 17, and sadly may have been having an episode when she died.

Concerns grew when the rented room's gate remained shut for two consecutive days, prompting neighbors to alert the police. Upon arrival, officers were forced to break open the gate, where they discovered the decomposed body.

Her body has not yet been found.

Two suspects were arrested.

> Police say Carmen de Oliveira Alves, 25, was murdered on June 12, Valentine's Day, in Ilha Solteira, São Paulo. Roberto Carlos de Oliveira, who was in a relationship with Marcus Yuri, acted as an accomplice, according to police. The pair were arrested on Thursday (10).
> 
> The police chief investigating the disappearance of 25-year-old transgender student Carmen de Oliveira Alves revealed that her boyfriend, the prime suspect in the crime, refused to acknowledge the relationship, which may have motivated the murder in Ilha Solteira, São Paulo. The investigation indicated that he committed the crime on June 12, Valentine's Day, when the victim disappeared.
> 
> Carmen's disappearance completes four weeks on Saturday (12). As reported by the report, the occurrence, which was initially treated as a disappearance of a person, is now being investigated as femicide. However, the police have not located Carmen's body.
> 
> On Thursday night (10), the police served temporary arrest warrants, for 30 days, against her boyfriend, Marcos Yuri Amorim, and the reserve environmental military police officer, Roberto Carlos de Oliveira, who worked in Ilha Solteira. Miguel Rocha told TV TEM that the investigation revealed that Carmen pressured Yuri to assume the relationship, in addition to discovering that he committed crimes, such as theft, which would also have motivated the murder.
> 
> ""On Valentine's Day, he ended up killing her. In our investigation, we discovered a folder deleted on the 12th, containing a dossier Carmen had compiled against Yuri,"" the police chief commented. The police also concluded that Roberto Carlos, in turn, acted as Yuri's accomplice, as he also had a relationship with him. According to the police chief, the emotional and financial ties between the suspects were revealed to be part of the dynamic.
> 
> The pair were interviewed and denied the crime, according to the police chief. Roberto's defense attorney, Miguel Micas, told G1 that he will prove his innocence. The report is still trying to contact Yuri's defense.
> 
> Furthermore, tracking of the student's cell phone showed that the last place she was was her boyfriend's house in a settlement. Security camera footage also shows that she left Unesp, entered her boyfriend's residence, but did not leave. According to the delegate, the investigation revealed that the suspects killed Carmen and hid the body.
> 
> According to the mother's report to the police, the day before her disappearance, on Wednesday (11), around 11 pm, the young woman left home with a black electric bicycle. Her bicycle was not found. Family members also claim that Carmen had never disappeared before.

> Prior to the murder, Pakdel had taken refuge in a hostel in Shiraz along with other trans individuals from various cities. She was fleeing domestic violence and living in precarious conditions due to the absence of support systems and societal protections.

Several weeks later police charged their boyfriend with homicide.

*Editor's Note: As there are conficting reports of how JJ identified, gender neutral pronouns are used in this report.*

> Last week, we reported on the disappearance of a 26 year old trans drag artist from Canton, Ohio. Sadly, police have now determined this is a homicide investigation.
> 
> Canton police announced late Thursday that the disappearance of JJ Godbey is now a homicide investigation. They’ve charged Daniel Mattay, Ryan’s former boyfriend, with four felonies: murder, felonious assault, strangulation and domestic violence.“New evidence has led our agency to transition the case from a missing person to a homicide investigation,” Canton Police Chief John Gabbard wrote in a news release. “While [JJ] Godbey has not yet been located, the new evidence makes it clear that [they are] deceased and that Mr. Mattay is responsible.”
> 
> I cannot begin to imagine how JJ’s family and friends are coping with these developments, waiting for someone to find them. That’s an ‘in between’ space of such heartbreak.
> 
> Note: There are conflicting reports on how JJ identified. I will default to gender nonconforming (GNC) as a broad category and use they/them pronouns as well as the name JJ Godbey. The tragedy is that this young beautiful soul was robbed of life by someone they trusted, maybe loved. We should honor their identity, of course, but until that becomes more clear – and I don’t know how that could happen – I’m choosing to honor them in this way.
> 
> JJ was born and raised in the Canton, Ohio area. They graduated from Massillon Washington High School in 2017. Their social media lists Mariah Carey and Lady Gaga as favorites along with Pink and Ciara. JJ was also a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Their page lists a wide range of movies they enjoyed.
> 
> JJ was very popular in the regional LGBTQ community – supporting causes and local businesses as well as standing with the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting and supporting transgender rights. JJ was considered an excellent makeup artist, was named to homecoming court in high school and may have been in the band.
> 
> A few weeks before their disappearance, they shared a desire to take sewing lessons to make costumes. Prior to that, they expressed interest in learning how to tend bar.
> 
> JJ gave their first drag performance in September 2024. On their TikTok, they shared a video saying their interest in drag started very early.
>
> Rest in power, Jj. Your beautiful and generous spirit changed your community. I am sorry violence stole your life as you just got started.  I hope the overwhelming number of people who came looking for you is a source of comfort. They will always come looking. That’s our promise to you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.

In October 2025 authorities confirmed that partial remains found in July belonged to JJ.

Her death at the hands of a hooded gunman appears to have been a targeted execution.

> (Manila) – A hooded gunman in General Santos City in the southern Philippines carried out an apparent targeted killing on June 23, 2025, of a transgender rights activist who worked as a radio commentator, Human Rights Watch said today.
> 
> The media reported that an unidentified man shot Ali Jejhon Macalintal several times at the acupuncture clinic she owned in General Santos City, and fled on a motorcycle. Police said they were investigating whether Macalintal's history of activism, as well as her recent business ventures, were possible motives for the attack.
> 
> “Ali Macalintal's murder is a brutal reminder that engaging in any kind of activism in the Philippines carries grave risks,” said Carlos Conde, senior Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should leave no stone unturned in finding out why she was killed and who was responsible.”
> 
> Macalintal, a 39-year-old trans woman, was an activist for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where she also advocated for the rights of Muslim Filipinos, known as Moros, and Indigenous peoples. She was the deputy-secretary general of the human rights group Karapatan in General Santos City until 2018. She also worked as media liaison for the leftist activist group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan.
> 
> The authorities should fully and impartially investigate whether Macalintal’s killing was motivated by her political activism or her gender identity, Human Rights Watch said.

> In 2002, Macalintal and two other Moros were arrested for allegedly taking part in the bombing of a department store in General Santos City in which 15 people were killed. At the time, she was a member of the activist group Bayan Muna, which Philippine officials often targeted for harassment and “red-tagging” – the practice of alleging that individuals are members or sympathizers of the communist insurgent group New People’s Army.
> 
> Macalintal and her co-accused spent eight years in police detention before a court acquitted them in 2010, ruling that the evidence submitted by the authorities was inadmissible. She and the others alleged that they were mistreated and tortured in custody.
> 
> After her release, Macalintal continued her activism despite the threats she faced. In a statement, Karapatan said that Macalintal, in messages to them in 2024, reported harassment by government security forces. In 2019, in text messages viewed by Human Rights Watch, Macalintal received threats, one of them in the form of a media advisory that she had been shot to death. The threats did not deter her activism. “She was never afraid to speak truth to power and expose uncomfortable truths,” Reyna Valmores Salinas, spokesperson for the LGBT rights group Bahaghari, said in a statement.

> On June 23, 2025, a 24-year-old American citizen was found dead in custody of an immigration detention center in the Dominican Republic. Ezra Hulett identified as an intersex transgender person. He died at the Haina Detention Center in the Dominican Republic. Ezra also used the name Ezri Hajiune. To the best of my knowledge, Hajiune was a chosen name based in Japanese anime culture.
> 
> Ezra was a person who had lived with significant mental health illnesses and the impact of childhood trauma as per the family crowdfund.
> 
> The family reports that Ezra traveled to Puerto Rico where he went missing in March 2025. Some reports state Ezra living in a permanent residence for patients with mental illness in Puerto Rico. One social worker from Puerto Rico claims Ezra had been missing for over four months from the treatment program. From PR, Ezra attempted to travel to the Dominican Republic where he was detained by immigration authorities on March 15, 2025. He appeared via Punta Cana International Airport where security footage documented his arrival. Puerto Rican sources claim Ezra had a passport unbeknownst to the treatment facility.
> 
> Another source claims Ezra was taken into custody after being found homeless, wandering, showing signs of disconnection from reality, unable to identify himself, and amid reports of alleged assault, They further claim that Ezra displayed severe communication difficulties, an inability to self-identify, and behaviors that indicated a compromised mental health status. He was evaluated by mental health professionals, diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, and received treatment in the Dominican Republic.
> 
> The family contends that Ezra was detained allegedly due to a lack of documentation. He was then sent Sabana de la Mar on April 19, where he remained in custody for two days. It appears charges were not filed, but Ezra was sent on to the Haina detention center on April where he remained until his death in June.
> 
> Dominican authorities conducted an autopsy that found no signs of violence even though Ezra allegedly reported multiple incidents of sexual assault while in custody. They state that Ezra self-identified as male, using the name Ezri Hajune, which led to placement in the men’s area. Authorities also noted erratic behavior and inconsistencies about his nationality in addition to Ezra’s lack of Spanish.
> 
> Carlos Sanchez, a human rights attorney for The National Council for Human Rights advocated for Ezra, securing a court ordered evaluation in early May that was delayed by immigration officials until June 17. At that point, Ezra was transferred to a women’s unit where he died a few days later. Ezra’s family is further concerned that authorities did not release the body until June 27
> 
> Director Nelson Gutiérrez alleged that, during detention, Ezra was subjected to repeated sexual assaults by male detainees, claiming at least fifteen perpetrators were involved.
> 
> Ezra seems clearly to have been struggling with his mental health, self-care, safety, their literal nationality, and certainly language. That’s a lot of alarm bells. Sanchez figured it out, so it is deplorable for the Dominican government to claim they did not have the resources to meet the needs of Ezra or anyone else detained. But here in the US, we know how this plays out.
> 
> So the crime is certainly Ezra’s death, but also includes the allegations of multiple sexual assaults, the details around their detention, the details around their residential treatment in Puerto Rico, the policies of Dominican immigration authorities, the accuracy of existing documentation. Then there are questions about why Ezra left Puerto Rico and the trans/queer competency of their treatment. Questions about the Dominican Republic’s LGBTQ+ policies and immigration protocols.
> 
> According to the family GoFundMe, he was born at St. Peter’s Hospital in Albany, NY, and grew up in Clifton Park, attending Karigon Elementary/Gowana Middle School (Shenendehowa CSD) and winning an academic scholarship to Emma Willard School in Troy. Ezra had a gentle soul, a calm presence, and an extraordinary mind. He was deeply compassionate, sensitive, and brilliant—someone who moved through the world with quiet kindness.

> 
> The events, which occurred just minutes ago, are still being investigated. According to preliminary information, authorities arrived at the scene after receiving a report of a dead body, but no details are yet known about the circumstances of the crime or who may be responsible.
> 
> This new case adds to the worrying number of homicides against trans people in Colombia in 2025, amid rising violence and stigmatization of the LGBTIQ+ population, especially in areas with high levels of conflict and the absence of a state. According to data from the Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory, this is the 45th case recorded in Colombia.
> 
> The State must guarantee justice and implement urgent measures to protect trans women, particularly in areas like Buenaventura where being diverse is a constant risk. An official statement from the Police and the Prosecutor's Office is still expected in the coming hours; however, in light of this situation, the organization reminds authorities of their obligation to apply the guidelines established in Directive 006 of 2023 of the Attorney General's Office, which orders prosecutors to adopt measures to diligently investigate acts of violence motivated by prejudice against LGBTIQ+ people with enhanced due diligence. This directive also requires that the hypothesis of a hate crime be considered from the outset.
> 
> Caribe Afirmativo strongly rejects these events and hopes for a swift investigation and a prompt clarification of the facts.

Protected by her general inspector, who became her friend and defender, René returned home after legal proceedings in Guayaquil, always displaying gratitude and the innocent smile that characterized her.

> 
> Danielle Dehoniesto went to check on 27-year-old Kamora Woods at her northwest side apartment on Maidstone Road after neither she nor Woods’ friends could reach her. The door was unlocked, and Dehoniesto said the scene inside was something no parent should ever have to walk into.

> “I will never get that image out of my head,” Dehoniesto said. “I touched her, I said, ‘Kamora.’ When I touched her, she was cold. She was stiff.”

Kamora's mother described her as “very loved,” an animal-lover who could make anyone laugh. Someone with a big heart and a life cut far too short.""

> “She had no problem letting it be known she’s transgender. My daughter was not that type of person. I know there’s a lot of people out there that’s quick to say, ‘Well, she probably didn’t reveal it.’ No. Not with my daughter,” Dehoniesto said. “Regardless of her sexuality, regardless of what she was doing, it doesn’t make it right for somebody to take her life and make excuses for it.”
> 
> “Love your child. Accept your child for who they are because life is too short,” Dehoniesto said. “You don’t know what can happen.”

Wallace has a prior conviction for armed robbery, criminal confinement and resisting law enforcement.

> Sinaloa.- LGBTIQA+ organizations and human rights activists issued a statement demanding that the murder of La Vale, a trans woman found dead on June 28 in Ahome, be investigated as a hate crime based on gender identity.
> 
> Vale had been reported missing since June 15 and was found dead days later, on a plot of land in Ejido 5 de Mayo, in the aforementioned municipality.
> 
> Tiago Ventura, president of the Sinaloa Inclusive civil association, stated that La Vale's murder was not a crime of passion or a coincidence, but rather a hate-filled transfeminicidal crime. He therefore called on authorities to act with diligence, a gender perspective, and a differentiated approach.
> 
> In a joint statement signed by Erika Acosta, an LGBTIQA+ activist from Ahome, and Tiago Ventura, they condemned La Vale's murder and urged the State Attorney General's Office to investigate the incident as a hate crime based on gender identity, following protocols for action with a perspective on sexual diversity and human rights.
> 
> At the same time, they demanded that the media stop violating the memory and identity of trans people, as they have found that various media outlets have reported on the case using language that denies or erases their gender identity.
> 
> Finally, they demanded that the Sinaloa government implement urgent actions, with resources and political will, to prevent and eradicate violence against LGBTIQA+ populations, particularly trans women.
> 
> “We stand in solidarity with her family, her friends, and all the trans women who today feel fear, anger, and exhaustion. Vale had a name, a story, and dreams. She was murdered for who she was. This is called transphobia, and we cannot allow it to continue to be normalized,” they stated.

Her case is one of several similar involving suicidal young people and AI chatbots reported at the time.

> Friends and family had long known Alice Carrier struggled with mental health issues, but they had no idea what AI was responding in chats in the hours before she died by suicide.
> 
> What they discovered on her phone prompted her girlfriend and her mother to speak out about the advice chatbots may be dispensing to those in crisis.
> 
> “It’s not so much that the robot came out of the phone and killed her,” says 19-year-old Gabrielle Rogers. “But it definitely did not help.”
> 
> Alice and Rogers had been dating for months and spending a lot of time together in the last few weeks of June. On July 3, after a fight, Rogers began to worry her girlfriend had stopped answering text messages. She went over to her apartment but couldn’t get in.
> 
> “So, I called the police to do a wellness check, and they went in and said, ‘she is dead,’” says Rogers.

> The suicide of Liam, a 16-year-old transgender teenager in Pereira, once again highlights the multiple failures in the mental health care of children and adolescents by institutions, the educational system, and society, particularly for trans children and adolescents, who are more exposed to hate speech and rejection in physical and digital environments.

> In addition, they demanded the implementation of public policies with a human rights focus and protection for trans and LGBTIQ+ people in the state.

Her murder caused widespread upset in her area.

Following her murder the Antioquia Governor's Office offered a reward of 20 million pesos for information leading to the arrest of those responsible.

> July 25, 2025. In recent hours, the body of Fernanda Domicó, a renowned social leader, indigenous trans woman, and head of the Volunteer Fire Department of the municipality of Dabeiba, in western Antioquia, was discovered. The circumstances surrounding her death have not yet been clarified, but they have already generated profound shock both in the municipality and at the regional level, where Fernanda was widely recognized for her commitment to the defense of human rights, the protection of life, and the protection of LGBTI people in community settings.
> 
> This incident, which has brought grief to LGBTIQ+ people in Urabá, cannot be treated as an isolated incident. Rather, it is part of a structural pattern of systematic violence against trans women and sex workers, who face differentiated risks marked by social exclusion, stigmatization, poverty, and the lack of institutional guarantees for the full exercise of their rights.
> 
> This murder adds to a long list of incidents. The Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory records 50 cases in 2025. A discouraging figure that exposes the rise in violence against trans people in Colombia, as announced at the IACHR hearing on violence in the country. 
> 
> Caribe Afirmativo demand that the Attorney General's Office and Barranquilla Metropolitan Police conduct a thorough investigation with a differentiated approach, applying the Protocol for the Investigation of Murders of LGBTI+ People and considering the hypothesis of a hate crime. Furthermore, we demand that the investigation include specific protocols that recognize her gender identity, ethnic origin, and role as a human rights defender.
> 
> Justice for Fernanda. Her voice remains a flame of dignity.

Toni Asik,25,4 Aug 1999,,,trans_flag.jpg,28 Jul 2025,,"Ashford, Surrey",United Kingdom,GB,51.43352758,-0.48219983,custodial,died in custody,"Toni died in custody in HMP Bronzefield, a privately run prison. Despite being suicidal he had inappropriately been placed without support in a female ""healthcare"" unit.

> 25 year old Toni Asik, a trans man, tragically died while in the care of Sodexo Limited, the private company running HMP Bronzefield. Toni, was consistently misgendered and mistreated by staff at the prison. Despite repeatedly disclosing that he was suicidal, he was placed in the prison’s “healthcare” unit, a wing known for housing women with severe mental health issues, rather than being given appropriate support.
> 
> This so-called healthcare unit, run by CNWL NHS Foundation Trust, is notorious for neglect, dirty conditions, and dehumanising treatment across their four locations. Women in crisis have reported being held like animals in cages, ignored when they cry for help, and forced to resort to dirty protests to have their voices heard.
> 
> There is no 24-hour healthcare provision at Bronzefield. Despite promises on Sodexo’s website, there is no resident GP after 7pm. The prison healthcare system is understaffed and mismanaged. Clinical leads, Harriet Tizzard and Dave Wilkinson, are under investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), and the GP Dr Omar Welehey is being investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC) for failures in providing appropriate care and misunderstanding what “parity of healthcare” really means, namely, that prisoners should receive the same standard of care as they would in the community.
> 
> Toni’s death is not an isolated case. Prisoners with serious health conditions at Bronzefield are consistently gaslit, lied to, and denied reasonable adjustments. This is not healthcare. It is neglect.
> 
> Despite CNWL recently being awarded over £8 million in NHS prison contracts, women at Bronzefield still struggle to access basic GP appointments. Why was Toni left alone in his cell for hours despite sounding his alarm? Why were emergency services delayed yet again? Surrey Ambulance Service has already raised serious safeguarding concerns about access routes into the prison, but nothing changes.
> 
> Following Toni’s death, Bronzefield’s Deputy Director Angie Dench, a former police officer, and Head of Residential Christine Morrison delivered self-congratulatory speeches to staff, praising their response. This performance stands in stark contrast to the brutal reality experienced by those inside.
> 
> The supposed investigation by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman (PPO), led by Adrian Usher, offers little hope. Prisoners’ complaints often don’t even reach the right facility, and the system lacks the independence or competence to hold anyone truly accountable.
> 
> To make matters worse, just 24 hours after Toni’s death, another inmate, Tracy Dyke,  was found unresponsive in House Block 1, a detox unit. Two deaths in two days. How many more?
> 
> Toni’s friends, still grieving, were further traumatised when a prison officer, identified as Officer Perry on House Block 2, was heard loudly singing “Beautiful girls”, (‘you make me suicidal),  in a way that was cruel and triggering. This kind of behaviour demands immediate investigation for misconduct in public office.
> 
> We are calling for an urgent inquiry, an end to Sodexo’s contract, and a complete overhaul of how we treat women and trans people, in custody. Bronzefield is not a place of rehabilitation or care. It is a place of systemic neglect and state-sanctioned trauma.
> 
> If you have information about conditions at HMP Bronzefield, please email: admin@theviewmagazine.org. We are determined to expose the truth and shut this facility down.
> 
> Join our Bronzefield Action Group to hold the government to account enough public money has been wasted on this failing provider. 
> 
> Toni’s death must not be in vain.

A suspect was subsequently sentenced to 7 years in prison.

> A man was sentenced this Friday for the murder of a 29-year-old trans woman, shot in the head at her home in the Bella Italia neighborhood. The incident occurred on calles Copérnico and Carlomagno.
> 
> According to police information on the case, several criminals entered the nine-square-meter precarious home and opened fire on the people who were there at the time.
> 
> There were two people in the house: a 29-year-old trans woman with five prior criminal records for theft, fraud, and receiving stolen goods, and a 33-year-old man. The woman died at the scene after being shot in the head, while the man was wounded and ran from the house.
> 
> The police and prosecutors' hypothesis is that the attack was directed at the man and that the trans woman was a collateral victim. In this case, Homicide Unit investigators conducted several raids in the Bella Italia area and arrested the perpetrator.
> 
> Following the court hearing, the man was sentenced to seven years in prison for the homicide. The investigation into the case continues, as the police believe there may be more people involved in the crime.


Following the murder the Uruguayan state expressed its sorrow at Joana's killing.

> From the Human Rights Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic, we express our profound sorrow and outrage at the murder of a trans person on July 29th. A crime that has plunged the entire society into mourning and challenges us to redouble our commitment to human rights, equality, and dignity.
>
> We reaffirm the value of the right to life. Today, as so often, communication fails once again, denying and rendering invisible a person's gender identity, even after death.
> 
> From this office, we advocate for respect for the life and identity of every person. Proper naming is not a symbolic act; it's an act of justice, memory, and dignity.
> 
> Denying identities is another form of violence. It makes people invisible, it perpetuates hatred and exclusion that all too often result in murder, and it violates human rights.

According to information published by the Primerplanoonline website, the results indicated that the compression exerted on Parra's neck caused mechanical asphyxiation and pulmonary edema.
> 
> Sources involved in the case indicated that the victim and suspect had been together for approximately eight months and that there were sporadic arguments. They also noted excessive alcohol consumption by both parties. However, the records show no prior reports of violence or restraining orders.
> 
> After the forensic diagnosis was confirmed, several people close to Parra sought out his partner to confront him. The man, identified as JCC, 47, showed up at the police station claiming to fear retaliation for the lynching attempts, but was ultimately arrested.
> 
> The prosecutor ordered his arrest, and he was taken into police custody. The man remains in the 6th precinct, awaiting the preliminary hearing scheduled for Wednesday, while the case progresses. The charge against him is the murder of a transgender woman, within the context of domestic violence.

Two months later her aggressor - who had previously issued death threats against her - was himself killed in a stabbing attack.

> Violence has rocked the island once again. In Remedios, Villa Clara, a double murder has left its mark on the community in just a few months.
> 
> In [August] Claudia Dayanis Acosta - a young trans woman - was stabbed inside a bar by a man identified as Yendis Hernández. Now, Yendis himself — who has been identified as Yendis Germán — has been killed with fourteen stab wounds on the outskirts of town, in an apparent act of revenge carried out by Yuristani Carvajal, according to multiple citizen reports. Yuristani, according to several sources who spoke to Niover Licea, is barely 16 or 17 years old.
> 
> Claudia's case had a profound impact on Remedios. Much loved by her neighbors and acquaintances, she was brutally attacked by Yendris, who, according to journalist Niover Licea, had committed a similar act in the past. We don't know why, despite such a history, Yendris was free on the streets now in October.
> 
> Messages circulated on social media not only highlighting the brutality of the attack, but also the threats the young woman received from her attacker: ""If she reported him, he would kill her."" After the incident, Claudia became a symbol of the lack of protection for trans people in Cuba, exposed to violence that rarely finds a swift and effective institutional response.
> 
> However, now, in the early hours of Monday morning, the story took a bloody turn, and the stabber became the victim. The attacker himself was found dead, with fourteen stab wounds that reflect a pattern of cruelty similar to the one he had used against Claudia.
> 
> Yuristani Carvajal's name appears in multiple publications as the perpetrator, although there has yet to be official confirmation from the authorities. The community interprets the outcome as a settling of scores, an act of revenge that highlights the lack of justice and the erosion of trust in institutions, according to Niover Licea himself.
> 
> The echo on social media mixes anger, resignation, and calls for a firm hand. But beyond the clamor for exemplary punishments, the central message is that Claudia's stabbing, and the death of Yendris are symptoms of the same evil: a country where violence is growing faster than the state's response.

Elizabeth Sánchez (""Eli""),44,,,,trans_flag.jpg,5 Aug 2025,,"Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua",Mexico,MX,31.73980902,-106.4953846,violence,stabbed,"Eli was killed by her boyfriend in her home salon. He has been charged with aggravated femicide.

> On Tuesday afternoon, a new case of violence shook the LGBT community in Ciudad Juárez with the discovery of the lifeless body of a trans woman, known as ""Eli,"" inside her beauty salon located at the intersection of Cobre and Miguel Hidalgo streets in the Gregorio M. Solís neighborhood.
> 
> Eli, originally from Veracruz, was a well-known figure in the industry for her work as a stylist at her business, a pink beauty salon that also served as her home. According to neighbors, she lived with more than five dogs and often shared time with her partner, with whom she frequently drank alcohol.
> 
> The body was found lying on a bed, covered with a blanket. The presence of the animals hampered emergency responders' initial access, so personnel from the Animal Care and Welfare Department (DABA) intervened to secure the dogs and allow authorities to enter.
> 
> Unofficially, neighbors recalled a disturbing incident: approximately eight years ago, Eli's then-boss was murdered in the same room as the beauty salon, sparking consternation and speculation about the coincidence of circumstances in this location.
> 
> Members of the Municipal Public Security Secretariat, the State Attorney General's Office, forensic experts, and personnel from the Forensic Medical Service responded to the scene to conduct the necessary investigations. The official cause of death has not yet been confirmed by authorities.
> 
> The discovery of Eli's body has sparked outrage in Ciudad Juárez's LGBT community, which is demanding justice and greater protection for transgender people in a city marked by gender-based violence.

A 30 year-old suspect in the double murder subsequently died by suicide.

> Kanpur: Unidentified assailants broke into a house in Yogendra Vihar on Saturday night, committed robbery before strangling a transgender person and a 12-year-old adopted brother.
> 
> The household wardrobe was found open, and jewellery, including gold bangles, was reported missing. The transgender [woman]'s body was discovered inside a divan of the bed, while the boy's body was found on the floor. Police and forensic investigations indicated that the bodies were approximately four days old and had begun to decompose. The victims' mother, Gudiya, accused two young men, who had previously danced with her transgender daughter, Kajal, of committing the murders.
> 
> During the investigation, open bottles of alcohol and food were found in the house. Originally from Dharampur in the Krishnanagar police station area of Mainpuri, Brijesh Dubey's family included his wife Gudiya, elder transgender daughter Kajal, younger daughter Chandni, and adopted son Deva.

> 
> A strong odour greeted her, and she screamed upon finding Deva's body on the floor. Neighbours arrived but retreated due to the strong smell. Upon being informed, DCP (South) Deependra Nath Chaudhary, ADCP Yogesh Kumar, ACP Chitranshu Gautam, the Hanumant Vihar police force, and a forensic team reached the scene. Gudiya informed the police that her daughter Kajal was missing. Upon searching the house, Kajal's body was found inside a divan. The DCP stated that the bodies appeared to be about four days old and had started decomposing. ""Both were strangled.
> 
> The bodies were sent for post-mortem, which will provide more clarity,"" he said. According to family members, Kajal lived in the city for some time, performing dances at weddings and parties, often with other transgender individuals. The house in Yogendra Vihar belonged to Abhimanyu Singh from Shyam Nagar, arranged by Devika, a fellow transgender person living nearby, who also reported the incident.The DCP said that the family accused two men of robbery followed by murder.

> A 27-year-old white trans woman is the latest recorded victim of fatal violence in Louisville, Kentucky. Blair Sawyer was riding her bicycle when she was hit by a moving car, then fell off her bike with fatal injuries.
>
> Police say the impact caused the bicyclist to be knocked off. The driver did not stop, continuing in an unknown direction. The rider was taken to University of Louisville Hospital where they were declared dead. Police have not released more information about the vehicle that struck and killed Blair, according to WDRB except that they are looking for a Ford Taurus.

> As per usual, the media and law enforcement information misgenders Blair.
>
> Until the driver is found and the details surrounding the accident (or incident) are clear, we can’t assume that this was unrelated to Blair’s identity. We don’t know. Clearly a crime was committed when the driver drove away and did not stop to render aid. But so much else remains unknown.

Ethan Neineker, 32, was arrested after the murders.

> The fiancée of a trans woman killed in a triple homicide has criticised a police precinct for deadnaming her.
> 
> Rosa Machuca was found dead in a parking lot in Austin, Texas, after a shooting at a local Target where she reportedly worked. She was just 24.
> 
> Officers responding to the shooting on Monday (11 August) reportedly found Machuca with several gunshot wounds, as well as the body of an elderly man and a four-year-old child, at the Target off Ohlen Road, Austin.
> 
> The following day, the Austin Police Department released names and photos of the deceased, but reportedly used Rosa’s deadname – a term used to refer to a trans person’s name pre-transition.
> 
> Machuca’s fiancée, Kim Dang, told local outlet KXAN she was “very hurt” by seeing her partner’s deadname used by the police. “I knew she never wanted to be recognised as her deadname,” she said. “I never wanted them to be remembered as their deadname. I want them to be remembered for who they really, truly want to be.”
> 
> Dang, who had reportedly been in an 11-year relationship with Machuca since high school, said her partner came out as trans in 2022 and had been using her chosen name for several years. She said Rosa had been reluctant to change her legal name given the anti-trans climate in Texas – one of the most anti-LBGTQ+ states in the US – and was “waiting for the right moment.”
> 
> Police have reportedly arrested a 32-year-old man, Ethan Neineker, in connection with the incident. Investigating officers said on Tuesday afternoon that Neineker has been charged with First-Degree Felony Murder of Rosa, as well as two counts of Capital murder of a 4-year-old girl and her grandfather.

> León, Guanajuato .- Last Friday (August 15), Monica, a trans woman was murdered in the Vista Esmeralda neighborhood, to this day her body is still in the Guanajuato Prosecutor's Office because she was never registered as a civil partner. 
>
> Acquaintances of Mónica Hernández, 31 years old, have claimed her body, but it has not been able to be delivered because they do not have a legal personality that identifies her as a person, since it seems she was never registered as a civil servant, explained Ricardo Gallardo, representative of the Ofarrel Family AC.
>
> “Mónica was originally from Mexico City. The people who approached us are friends from here in León who told us that when she was a child in Mexico City, she was abandoned by her biological family and adopted by another family, but voluntarily, not legally, so she never had a registration, birth certificate, or document that gave her legal personality,” he explained.

> Fascinación Jiménez, a representative of the Diverse Union of Jalisco, also demanded that hate speech be penalized at the federal and state levels. 
> 
> ""Today we are sharing the unfortunate news of the transfemicide of Joselinne Páez in Tepatitlán, Morelos. This comes one week after the murder of Katia in the municipality of Zapotlán el Grande, also in Jalisco. We at Unión Diversa de Jalisco believe that these are not isolated cases.  
> 
> ""This is the consequence of hate speech and the wave of hate speech that has emerged worldwide from anti-rights groups in the United Kingdom, the United States, Argentina, and even Mexico. These speeches, like those of Lili Tellez and Eduardo Berastegui, translate into violence. From here, what we are demanding is that the investigation be conducted with a gender and sexual diversity perspective, that prosecutors' offices be trained in this same regard, and that they use the federal protocols that already exist""'.

> On the night of last Saturday (16), around 9:20 pm, a trans woman was found dead inside a residence located on Rua Ticuna, in the Parque dos Carajás neighborhood, in Parauapebas, southeast of Pará.
> 
> The victim was identified as Wendelly Gabrielly ([cachinhos_g1w](https://www.instagram.com/cachinhos_g1w/)), a 22 year old trans woman. The body showed signs of mechanical asphyxiation and was found with a cloth wrapped around her neck.
> 
> The Military Police were called by residents who noticed the situation and, upon arrival, confirmed the death. The area was cordoned off until the arrival of the Civil Police and the Forensic Medical Institute (IML), who carried out the necessary procedures.
> 
> According to preliminary information, the young woman worked as a [sex worker]. Investigations are seeking to determine whether the homicide may be linked to a possible transphobic crime or other factors.
> 
> After news of the death broke, malicious and prejudiced comments about the victim began to circulate on social media.
> 
> The Pebinha de Açúcar Portal team emphasizes that this type of demonstration, besides being disrespectful, constitutes a crime. In 2019, the Supreme Federal Court (STF) ruled that homophobia and transphobia should be classified under Law No. 7,716/1989, which addresses crimes resulting from racial or color-based prejudice. In other words, hate speech against LGBTQIA+ people is punished in the same way as racism, with penalties ranging from one to five years in prison, plus a fine.

> The 31 year old woman was found dead in the front yard of a home in the 1100 block of Rivermont Avenue around 8:58 p.m. Law enforcement and media have misgendered and deadnamed Kasí .
> 
> At approximately 8:58 p.m., the Lynchburg Police Department and Lynchburg Fire Department responded to a malicious wounding call in the 1100 block of Rivermont Avenue.
> 
> Police told ABC3 News that when they arrived on the scene, they found someone dead in the yard. Police have confirmed that the victim suffered from a gunshot wound. It is unclear if this was Kasi’s house or another residence.
> 
> There is no further information from the investigation BUT I did see some of the media coverage updated around Kasi’s name and identity. Her friends and family likely advocated on her behalf, a too often step in the grieving process.
> 
> Kasí went to Heritage High School and studied at Strayer University. She used the nickname Kaeyy Holmes.
> 
> According to her social media profiles, Kasí was open about her struggle with depression. She professed herself a woman of faith. As recently as August 2023, she had her pick of three job offers including one she genuinely wanted. It also appears she was a talented and highly sought after hair stylist for children and adults.

> Kasi was very into being a Scorpio and followed multiple astrology pages. Her music tastes include Cardi B, Ciara, and Missy Elliott.

> Rest in power, Kasi. Thank you for the beauty and wonder you brought to this world with your artistry. Thank you for loving your family and friends, love that will echo through generations. I am sorry we did not create a safer, kinder world for you.

> May your memory be a revolution.

Subsequently Lynchburg Police arrested and charged Victor Dale Giles, 40, with first-degree murder.

Onyx Cornish,18,12 Apr 2007,photos/2025_08_18_Onyx-Cornish.jpg,https://www.instagram.com/p/DN8J3ncjWrj/,thumbnails/2025_08_18_Onyx-Cornish.jpg,18 Aug 2025,,"Caldwell, Idaho",USA,US,15.4804665,-87.992017,violence,shot,"Onyx died after being shot by their adoptive father. 

Delbert Cornish was arrested on 18th August is being held without bail.

> Onyx Cornish (2007–2025) was a queer & trans teenager, allegedly murdered by their adoptive father.
> 
> Last week, a trans teenager was shot to death in their bedroom in Caldwell, Idaho; their father has allegedly confessed. The case has been widely reported on, but, as is common when trans and nonbinary people are killed, journalists have attempted to render them cisgender through a mixture of ignorance and deliberate excision. Onyx has been exclusively referred to as a woman and a daughter, and their chosen name has often been treated — and stylised — as a nickname to be subordinated to their birth name, including on their obituary.
> 
> My friend, researcher Ilya Maude, noticed tells in the reported story and found Onyx’s Instagram (which is public, but which I won’t link directly in case of malicious attention). On it, their pronouns are listed as he/they/she. Their friends have been using they/them in their eulogies for Onyx, which I am following here.
> 
> Onyx lived in one of the most conservative US states — a state that broke for Trump by a 36.5% margin in 2024 — and described their family on IG as a conservative family. (Their pinned Instagram reels include PSAs about Project 2025 and information about seeking abortion pills in red states.) It’s striking, then, that even as a teenager in a conservative context, they asserted themselves firmly enough that their queerness and genderqueerness has been impossible to erase after their death. It has been widely reported that they went by Onyx, even as this has been treated in practice as an extension of their alt style. Most revealingly, and bleakly, their father is stated to have wrapped them in a pride flag after killing them. (A rainbow flag is visible on their wall in some reels.)
> 
> He has allegedly stated that he planned to kill himself and all of his three children, saying that they were being “bullied” by his brother — who owned the house in which Onyx was living — with insults like “paedophile” and “loser.” It is difficult not to suspect that Onyx was the primary target of this abuse. Onyx was shot immediately after opening their bedroom door and died about 20 minutes later. Onyx’s younger brother was also threatened with a gun after arriving home from school, but thankfully managed to talk down and disarm his father, who left the property.
> 
> Onyx loved heavy metal, alt fashion and makeup, and their friends, who they described as getting them through rough periods in their life, including a period of some time in which they were kicked out of the house. They loved their cat, Sami, who was sadly also shot and killed after their own murder. They enjoyed showing off their makeup looks online and described themselves as both pretty and handsome. They celebrated getting sober in 2024. Their last available Instagram story is from three weeks ago, where they were celebrating one of their closest friends’ birthdays at a picnic. All the attendees wore flower garlands on their heads. They looked happy.
> 
> Queer and trans youth deserve better than their state and their families. The family, said to offer protection, so often kills and starves.
> 
> We must mourn and honour our dead.

Onyx´s Instagram profile (@_.the.x.inbetween.) has subsequently been deactivated, effectively erasing their online identity.

> Municipal Police officers arrived at the scene and cordoned off the area to protect the crime scene, awaiting the experts from the State Attorney General's Office (FGE ), who will be in charge of carrying out the respective investigations, in addition to ordering the removal of the body for its transfer to the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo) , where the legal autopsy will be performed.

Hearing her screams, neighbours apprehended and nearly lynched her killer.

> A trans woman was beaten to death inside a home in the Xochimilco district of Mexico City, and the victim's neighbors defended her and tried to lynch the alleged perpetrator.
> 
> The case was reported by journalist Carlos Jiménez , who claimed that the attacker was identified as César 'N' and that his actions caused her death in just a few minutes.
> 
> On August 21, 2025, César 'N' attacked a trans woman until he took her life. The victim's screams alerted the neighbors, who, in an act of justice by their own hand, managed to intercept the aggressor when he tried to flee. 
> 
> The outrage was so great that residents severely beat César 'N', almost lynching him, before members of the Citizen Security Secretariat (SSC) arrived. 
> 
> The Tepepan Sector police finally arrested the suspect, who was transferred to the Attorney General's Office of Mexico City (FGJ CdMx).
> 
> At this time, the exact motives behind this crime are unknown. However, the case has been classified as a transfemicide, a term that seeks to highlight and recognize the systematic and lethal violence directed against trans women in Mexico.

> The death of María del Mar Perdomo, a renowned trans designer and advocate for inclusive fashion, has caused shock in Santa Marta and her hometown, Neiva.

> The circumstances of her death, marked by suspicion of scopolamine poisoning and the possibility of robbery, have prompted an exhaustive investigation by the authorities.
>
> The designer's discovery occurred in the context of an event seeking to highlight diversity and inclusion in fashion, causes to which Perdomo dedicated a good part of her career. According to preliminary reports from people close to her, the main hypothesis points to scopolamine poisoning that may have triggered a sudden heart attack.

An investigator from the agency explained that they are reviewing security cameras at the hotel and surrounding areas, in addition to reconstructing the victim's final hours to determine whether third-party involvement was involved. The investigation remains open, and authorities have urged caution in light of the circulation of unconfirmed reports.

A travel advisory on scopolamine poisioning published by the U.S. Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) in 2012 stated:

> ""One common and particularly dangerous method that criminals use to rob a victim is through the use of drugs. Scopolamine is most often administered in liquid or powder form in foods and beverages. The majority of these incidents occur in nightclubs and bars. It is recommended that to avoid becoming a victim of scopolamine, a person should never accept food or beverages offered by strangers or new acquaintances, nor leave food or beverages unattended in their presence. Victims of scopolamine or other drugs should seek immediate medical attention.""

However, an autopsy described her death as being due to natural causes.

*[Editor's Note: Because of the discrepencies between the two reports, Shantal's death is recorded here as ""not reported"", although in reality two possible causes of death were reported - one through violence, and one by natural causes.]*

> On September 19, Caribe Afirmativo, an NGO that promotes respect for and recognition of the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the Colombian Caribbean, denounced the violent death of a trans woman, identified as Shantal.
> 
> In a statement, the organization said the trans woman, who was the popular queen of the Rebolo Gay Carnival and also a cultural leader, was the victim of a violent attack, for which she remained in intensive care for several days .
> 
> However, EL HERALDO learned of Shantal's death certificate, which certifies that her death was due to natural causes.
> 
> According to the general, authorities learned of this case after reading the statement issued by Caribe Afirmativo, so they began investigating.
> 
> ""The information we have is that the homeless woman, who was also a trans woman, was admitted to the health center for respiratory problems. There, they detected that she had tuberculosis, and that was the cause of death. She also apparently had a second HIV diagnosis,"" explained the MEBAR commander, noting that this information was shared by the doctor with the human rights official.
> 
> He noted that the institution was not aware of the case earlier because it was not a violent death, but a natural one: ""She did have some bruises on her arms, according to what they told me, but according to what the doctor said, they were bruises from some time ago, not recent. The cause of death was tuberculosis, a respiratory infection, which is why the body was not taken to the Forensic Medicine Department because the death certificate was listed as natural,"" he explained.

Her case is suspected to have been a homicide.

> This Sunday morning (21), the body of Carol, also known as [possible deadname], was found in an advanced state of decomposition in the community of São Paulo do Araguari, about 3 am from the municipality of Cutias. 
> 
> According to reports, Carol was invited to cook in the community for a group of workers building a fence near the river. Carol disappeared on the second day of her stay in the community, but her disappearance was only reported four days after her disappearance. There are reports that there was a video circulating in the community where the workers claimed that Carol went into a fit wanting to enter the river, but she did not know how to swim. 
> 
> In the video, she was allegedly tied up by the workers who said she was having a ""fit"". She has no history of mental illness and did not know how to swim. 
> 
> The case took a turn when the police were called and were unsuccessful in their search. Only when the fire department was called to conduct a thorough sweep this Sunday morning, after four days of searching, Carol's body was found. As she was affectionately known in the municipality of CUTIAS, she was loved and well-regarded by the population, kind, and always very cheerful. 
> 
> Carol leaves family and friends in search of justice . 

Is this a life lost in yet another crime against an LGBTQIAPN+ person? The police are investigating, but so far there are no suspects.

She  died in a medical centre after being hit by a stray bullet during a firefight between a police patrol and a fugitive.

> September 22, 2025. In the early hours of September 22, 2025, a new act of violence erupted, saddening Colombia's diverse population. Karen, known by the community as ""Mariana"" or ""La Jassan,"" a trans woman, was murdered in the La Esmeralda neighborhood of Popayán, amid a firefight during a police operation.
> 
> According to the facts, the victim was not involved in the confrontation, but was caught in the middle of it, being shot by National Police officers who, according to witnesses, failed to apply the civil protection protocols that should govern these procedures.
> 
> This case becomes the 55th recorded by the Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory in 2025, and the second this year in which a trans person has died as a result of violent actions carried out by law enforcement officers. This highlights the serious risk faced by people with trans life experience in contexts of institutional violence.
> 
> Karen's memory demands justice and respect. Colombian society cannot remain indifferent to the systematic violence faced by trans people, who daily demand dignity, recognition, and full citizenship guarantees.


Karen was well known in her community and a candlelight vigil was held for her shortly after her death.

> Despite the cold night in Payanes, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and loved ones of La Hassan, or Karen, the trans woman who died after being caught in the crossfire, gathered to pay tribute to her at the site of the tragedy: the El Cadillal neighborhood.

> She deserved it, for that gigantic heart she had and the powerful joy she radiated every time she walked the streets of this sector of the capital of Cauca, and as her friends and confidants clearly confirmed, they do not accept that a gunshot, apparently fired by a police officer, ended her life in the early hours of Monday, September 22.
> 
> Those who attended this event urged the Prosecutor's Office to expedite the investigation and impose exemplary punishment on the person responsible for this violent act. “Karen was a very special person to Carlos and I, especially in the last month, when we were very attentive to her, giving her a lot of love and receiving the same from her, so now facing her departure is something that hits us very hard. I shared a lot of time with this wonderful person. I met her more than twenty years ago, when she became my stylist at a hair salon in the Santa Clara neighborhood,” said Carol Chacón, who participated in this candlelight vigil.

> How will Maranhão society respond to the barbaric murder of Rubi, which occurred just a few days ago? She was an Indigenous trans woman.
> 
> To seek answers, let us remember: on April 15 of this year, the City Council of São Luís, capital of Maranhão, approved a bill that encourages misinformation, prejudice, hatred and violence against trans women. According to this illegal and absurd proposal, trans women in São Luís would not be able to use women's restrooms. There were occasional reactions from the State Public Defender's Office, members of parliament, and social organizations. Today, this issue—related to a law that encourages crime and barbarity—is hushed up.
> 
> It is important to remember this legislative attempt from the capital of Maranhão when we talk about Rubi, the victim of a heinous crime associated with deep structural problems—in this specific case, a transfemicide with clear traces of racism.
> 
> Last Monday (29/09), Rubi's body was found on the banks of the MA-006, in the municipality of Arame, 476 km from São Luís. The city has only 25 thousand inhabitants. The young woman was murdered with stab wounds.
> 
> The oligarchic media cartel of Maranhão reported the case following the old pattern of turning blood into a commodity. Soon after, a deafening silence set in—an institutional muteness—revealing the state's complicity in violent practices associated with exclusion and discrimination.
> 
> On the other hand, Rubi's case provoked deep indignation and repudiation in specific sectors (including outside Maranhão).
> 
> There is a need for social pressure to prevent impunity, in addition to the urgent need for more public policies — including educational ones — to combat racism, transphobia, and gender-based violence.
> 
> The issue demands visibility. However, judging by the state capital itself, if the status quo in Maranhão is maintained, this will be just another episode incorporated into the old, undesirably naturalized landscape.
> 
> The Maranhão government, currently led by agribusinessman Carlos Brandão, needs to be pressured to act with rigor, honesty, and transparency, adopting concrete measures to prevent any possibility of impunity or manipulation of the investigation.

On Tuesday 7th October two men were arrested on suspicion of Rubi's murder.
